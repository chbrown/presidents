And David Alston, I am as proud to have you on my crew now as I was thirty-five years ago.\nThis is no ordinary campaign because this is no ordinary time. We have lived through the most deadly attack on our people in American history, the greatest job loss since the Great Depression, and the greatest loss of wealth and savings ever recorded. But every time our country has faced great challenges, we have come through -- and come out stronger -- because courageous Americans have done what's right for America.\nThis is a time for the same kind of courage.\nI learned something about service from two people I wish could be here today. My father, who as a member of the Greatest Generation, enlisted in the Army Air Corps even before Pearl Harbor, and served in the State Department at the height of the Cold War. And my mother, 50 years a Girl Scout leader, a community activist with a passion for the environment who took me into the woods as a young boy and simply said \"listen.\"\nMy wife Teresa reminds me of the ideals of America. She is a naturalized citizen who came here from a dictatorship. And she loves the freedom and optimism America has to offer. She is caring and strong, a leader on many causes, and she speaks the truth -- and I love her for that too.\nVanessa, Alex, and Christopher are here, and I thank them for taking time out of their lives. For Teresa and me, all our children and now our first grandchild give us joy and pride everyday.\nAs I look around at my crewmates and the veterans here today, I am reminded that the best lessons I learned about being an American came in a place far away from America -- on a gunboat in the Mekong Delta with a small crew of volunteers. Some of us had been to college; others were just out of high school. But we grew up together on that tiny boat. It was our sanctuary -- and a place for bridging distances between California and South Carolina, Iowa and Massachusetts. We were no longer the kid from Arkansas or the kid from Illinois. We were Americans -- together -- under the same flag -- giving ourselves to something bigger than each of us as individuals.\nWe arrived as strangers; we left as brothers. We didn't think we were special. We just tried to do what was right.\nAnd when we came home, we had a simple saying: Every day is extra. I used my extra days to join other veterans to end a war I believed was wrong. I saw courage both in the Vietnam War and in the struggle to stop it. I learned that patriotism includes protest, not just military service. But you don't have to go half way around the world or march on Washington to learn about bravery or love of country. Again and again, in the causes that define our nation, we have seen the uncommon courage that is common to the American people.\nToday, with confidence in the courage of our people to change what is wrong and do what is right, I come here to say why I am a candidate for President of the United States.\nI am running so we can keep America's promise – to reward the hard work of middle class Americans and pull down the barriers that stand in their way and in the way of those struggling to join them; to restore our true strength in the world which comes from ideals, not arrogance; renew the commitment of our generation to pass this planet on to our children better than it was given to us.\nI reject George Bush's radical new vision of a government that comforts the comfortable at the expense of ordinary Americans, that lets corporations do as they please, that turns its back on the very alliances we helped create and the very principles that have made our nation a model to the world for over two centuries. An economic policy of lost opportunity and lost hopes is wrong for America. An international policy where we stand almost alone is wrong for America.\nGeorge Bush's vision does not live up to the America I enlisted in the Navy to defend, the America I have fought for in the Senate -- and the America that I hope to lead as President.\nAnd every day of this campaign I will challenge George Bush for fundamentally taking our country in the wrong direction. I will tell you what I believe and what we must do for our country -- and I'll show you how together we will defeat George Bush next November.\nFirst, we must restore a foreign policy that is true to our ideals. We will defend our national security and maintain a military that is the strongest armed force on earth. But, if I am President, I will never forget that even a nation as powerful as the United States needs to make some friends in this world.\nOverseas, George Bush has led and misled us on a course at odds with 200 years of our history. He has squandered the goodwill of the world after September 11 and lost the respect and influence we need to make our country safe.\nWe are seeing the peril in Iraq every day. I voted to threaten the use of force to make Saddam Hussein comply with the resolutions of the United Nations. I believe that was right -- but it was wrong to rush to war without building a true international coalition -- and with no plan to win the peace.\nSo long as Iraq remains an American intervention and not an international undertaking, we will face increasing danger and mounting casualties.\nBeing flown to an aircraft carrier and saying \"mission accomplished\" doesn't end a war. And the swagger of a President saying \"bring вЂ�em on\" will never bring peace.\nPride is no substitute for protecting our young men and women in uniform. Half the names on the Vietnam Memorial are there because of pride -- because of a President who refused to admit he was wrong. Pride is no excuse for making enemies overseas. It is time to return to the United Nations, not with the arrogance of Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz but with genuine respect. For the Bush Administration to reject the participation of allies and the UN is a miscalculation of colossal proportions. We need to end the sense of American occupation as fast as possible and take the targets off American soldiers.\nIn Iraq and across the world, we must share the burdens with our allies and the international community. Then, and only then, can we assemble a worldwide coalition truly sufficient to defeat the terrorists -- to keep the most dangerous weapons out of their hands and out of the reach of unstable regimes.\nHere again, George Bush is taking the world in the wrong direction. He is poised to set off a new nuclear arms race by building bunker-busting tactical nuclear weapons -- smaller and more usable nuclear bombs. I don't want a world with more useable nuclear bombs. I don't want America to turn its back on half a century of effort by every President to reduce the nuclear threat. I'm running to put America where we rightfully belong -- leading the way to a new international accord on nuclear proliferation to make the world itself safer for human survival.\nAt times in the term of the next President, we may well have to use force to fight terrorism. I will not hesitate to do so. But if I am President, the United States will never go to war because we want to, we will only go to war because we have to.\nAnd in the war against terrorism, let me state clearly what we all know in our hearts to be true: two years after the tragic events of 9/11 we have not made our nation safe enough. Overseas, our Commander-in-Chief turned to Afghan warlords for the assault on Tora Bora; Osama Bin Laden got away and today the Taliban and Al Qaeda are regrouping.\nAnd here on the home front, every investigation, every commission, every piece of evidence we have tells us that this President has failed to make us as safe as we should be.\nWe are not making progress when we are laying off police and the jobs of sky marshals are in jeopardy. If we can open firehouses in Baghdad, then we can keep them open in New York City.\nBut the threats today don't just come from gun barrels; they also come from oil barrels. The dollars we spend at the pump can too easily fund the terrorists who seek to destroy us. America will only be stronger if we never have to send our sons and daughters into battle for oil half a world away.\nWe have to disarm that danger by making America independent of Mideast oil within the next ten years. I know that the auto industry has political muscle. But we're in a time of war, and everyone should contribute to the cause. In World War II, Detroit was the arsenal of democracy. Today they need to raise their gas mileage and build the vehicles of the future that use clean, renewable energy like ethanol. I also know there are some in our own party who resist this because they fear it will cost jobs. But it's right for America -- and energy independence will create 500,000 new high-paying jobs right here in this country.\nOn energy and the environment, George Bush seeks to undo the progress of 30 years under Presidents of both parties. His Clean Skies initiative actually means dirtier air; his Healthy Forests proposal actually means cutting down trees. He proposed to let his oil industry friends drill in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. I led and won the fight to stop him.\nIn a Kerry Administration, we will recommit America to one of the greatest unfinished challenges of our time and of all time -- to save our environment, to protect our oceans, to reverse the tide of global warming. We will not let polluters rewrite our laws in return for campaign contributions. We will make them and not taxpayers pay the bill to clean up toxic waste. And we will disprove the lie that protecting the environment can only come at the expense of jobs.\nThe truth is that prosperity doesn't come from pollution. The most powerful economic engine in this nation has always been opportunity -- the ability for anyone from any start in life, to get a good education, to go to work, to start a business, to take an idea and change the world. But George Bush's only economic plan is lavish tax breaks for those at the top. He has taken us down the road of diminished opportunity, not greater opportunity.\nUnder the Bush Administration, in less than three years, three million jobs have been lost. That is an astonishing failure -- and it is an outrage.\nAs a Senator, I was proud to work with President Bill Clinton to turn around the last Bush downturn. And I know the people of this country have the courage to do what's right for our economy.\nIf I am President, I will rollback the Bush tax breaks for the wealthy so we can invest in education, health care, and the skills of our workers.\nSome in my own party want to get rid of all tax cuts -- including those for working families. That would mean that a family of four -- with two parents working hard on the job and at home -- would have to pay $2,000 more a year in taxes. That's wrong. We need to be on the side of America's middle class, and I've proposed a tax cut for them because it's the right way to strengthen our economy.\nLet me put it plainly: if Americans aren't working, America's not working. So my economic plan sets this goal -- to get back George Bush's three million jobs in my first 500 days as President. And to cut the budget deficit in half in the first four years.\nBut what we face today -- and what we must change -- is not simply a failure of policy. Today at the center of power, we have a radical ethic that ratifies and glorifies a creed of greed. Once, a great Republican President named Theodore Roosevelt took on those who abused their wealth and power; today's Republican President invites them in for secret meetings, sells out our environment, tolerates their abuses and lets them evade taxes by moving their headquarters to an offshore shelter that is nothing more than a post office box or a mail drop.\nDick Cheney's old company Halliburton has 58 offshore tax havens. The Bush Administration's response is to hand Halliburton a seven billion dollar no-bid contract.\nMy response as President will be:\n• No more lavish government-funded life support for favored corporations.\n• No more tax allowances for bonuses of over a million dollars for CEOs who have done nothing to earn them.\n• No more contracts for companies, no matter how well-connected they are, until they decide to do what's right.\n• And no more tax breaks that help companies move American jobs overseas.\nA tax code that once ran 14 pages now takes up 17,000 pages, filled with twists and turns and customized loopholes. Everyone in America knows it is not fair, and if I am President we're going to scour that tax code and make it simple and fair once and for all.\nInstead of tax breaks for the wealthiest and subsidies for special interests, and instead of photo opportunities with children as backdrops, let's give real meaning to the words \"leave no child behind.\" It's time to give our schools the resources and our teachers the respect they deserve -- and give every child in America the best possible start in life.\nAnd let's recognize that for all our wealth, we will be a lesser nation if we continue to be the only advanced society that does not secure access to health care for all our people. This is not an abstract issue to me. Early this year, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. I was cured -- because as a United States Senator, I was lucky to have some of the best medical care in the world. Millions of Americans are not so lucky -- and I'm determined to change that. I propose to give every American access to the same health coverage as a Senator or member of Congress. And I say to you today: Your family's health is just as important as any politician's in Washington.\nThe courage to do what's right means standing up for civil rights and equal rights – and ending discrimination against gay men and lesbians. And it means understanding that our civil liberties are not an obstacle to defending this nation, but are one of the very things we seek to defend.\nGeorge Bush has sought to undo guarantees enshrined in the Constitution -- not by amending it but by subverting it with his judicial nominees. As President, I will only appoint Supreme Court Justices who will uphold a woman's right to choose. A just America demands a Supreme Court that honors our Constitution -- and an Attorney General whose name isn't John Ashcroft.\nAnd courage means standing up for gun safety, not retreating from the issue out of political fear or trying to have it both ways. I'm a hunter and I believe in the Second Amendment but I've never gone hunting with an AK-47. Our party will never be the choice of the NRA -- and I'm not looking to be the candidate of the NRA.\nToday, I ask all of you to enlist in a mission that is bigger than any of us.\nFor each of us has extra days -- not just for ourselves but to share. And I hope to be the President who asks all of us to serve -- because in the end, the ideals of the nation will not be realized by Presidential decree, but by the national service that can only be measured in countless acts of individual commitment to do what's right for America – every day, in every community -- in many different ways -- from helping a child learn to read to giving senior citizens the chance to give more of their talents and strength.\nAnd the force of all those extra days joined together can open a new era of concern for others and not just ourselves, of community and not division, of opportunity for the many and not just the few.\nI believe the courage of Americans can change this country.\nI believe the idealism of Americans can match our power to our principles – so that this nation will advance the best hopes of the world.\nI believe the genius of Americans can make us energy independent.\nThe resolve of Americans can break the grip of special interests and bring back jobs and economic justice.\nThe vision of Americans can save our environment, raise up our schools, and finally open up health care to all.\nThe conscience of Americans can guard our fundamental liberties and preserve them for generations to come.\nYour courage can make sure we do what's right for our country.\nYour courage can give America back its future, its strength and its soul.\nI am honored to join you in this endeavor as a candidate for President of the United States.\nThank you and God bless you all.", "timestamp": "2003-09-02", "title": "Address Announcing Candidacy for President of the United States in Patriot's Point, South Carolina"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29667", "text": "Good morning and thank you for inviting me into this house of God and home of good works.\nAnd thank you Bishop Coleman, for being the rock upon which this community of worship was built.\nOn a Sunday thirty-nine years ago today, a courageous flock of God's children set out on Highway 80 to live the words that still call out to the faithful today:\n'When you pray, move your feet.'\nLed by my friend John Lewis and his fellow civil rights activist Hosea Williams, the 600 men and women crossed over the Edmund Pettis Bridge from Selma searching for freedom, justice, and equality at the gates of Montgomery, Alabama.\nBut on that Sunday in March, they did not find any of those things. Instead, they found billy clubs, tear gas, and blood.\nBloody Sunday was a turning point. Within forty-eight hours, demonstrations in support of the marchers were held in eighty cities across America. Within ten days, a federal judge ruled that they be permitted to march peacefully toward Selma. And within five months, the Voting Act of 1965 was signed into law.\nAnd if anyone ever asks you what it means to match words with deeds, tell them about Bloody Sunday - a day when faith was lived by the people who held it. A day when prayers were spoken with feet.\nAnd brothers and sisters, when they ask you if we can change America, if we can march forward for the vision we hold true today, just make it clear: if they could do that, if they could stand on that bridge, surely we know we can do this.\nWe need to remember that it was hope that conquered the despair of the marchers as they looked towards the entrance of Selma.\nEverywhere I go, I've seen the pain of America. I have seen it in the eyes of families who send out unanswered resumes week after week or take a job at one third of what they used to make just a couple years ago. I have felt worry in the embrace of children who've watched their father bury his head in his hands when he opens their mother's hospital bill. And I have heard despair in the voice of parents who work themselves to the bone until they cannot come home in time to tuck their children into bed.\nBut in every corner of this country, in every home, on every farm and in every factory, there was one sound in America that rings out louder than the pain and the worry and the despair. It was the sound of hope. Hope that we can bring change to America.\nI know we can get there. But to do it we need to find just a tiny bit of the courage of those marchers who knew they had to stand tall on that bridge on Bloody Sunday.\nWe're going to be tested - tested today, and tomorrow, and the next day. Tested in our faith, tested in our commitment to something bigger than ourselves - tested to find out whether our hope for the future is stronger than our fellow citizens' pessimism about the present.\nWe'll be tested to see how much we really remember the words of the scripture, 'What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds?' [James 2:14]\nWe need to remember those words so we march forward against a sorry politics where too often words suffice where deeds are demanded. Remember 'a uniter not a divider?' 'Compassionate conservative?' 'Clear Skies?' 'Healthy Forests?' 'A humble foreign policy?' 'Leave No Child Behind?' 'Weapons of Mass Destruction?' We have to march against not just a credibility gap, but a credibility Grand Canyon. We have to march against cynicism and disaffection, so we can show those who've stopped believing in our nation's common cause that we're different, that we will match our faith with our deeds.\nBut it won't be easy. You've lived with the attacks, the distortions, and the hollowness of a politics of last resort that divides black from white, rich from poor, Massachusetts from Mississippi. Some people want us pointing fingers at each other - so no one points the finger at them. We can do better than that. In this campaign, I've been reminded of something I first learned as a young man on a Navy boat on the other side of the world - that what holds us together as one people is so much more powerful than what divides us.\nWe're marching with faith - and determination that together we've come too far not to mean what we say and say what we mean. So we will restore a government that is a provider of opportunity instead of a tool of the privileged. We will honor hard work and mainstream values. We will give middle-class families a tax break and we will bring back lost jobs. We will make sure that your family's check-up doesn't empty the family checkbook. We will wake up every day ensuring that our communities are safe and America is protected.\nAnd we will walk towards a brighter tomorrow together because we will answer the call that President Kennedy spoke so long ago - that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own.\nAfter being beaten to within an inch of his life on Bloody Sunday, the story is told that John Lewis woke up in a hospital bed with Dr. King by his side. As Lewis opened his eyes and turned to his friend, Dr. King said, 'We'll make it to Montgomery, John. They're not going to stop us now.' My brothers and sisters, our time has arrived: we can bring change to America. And if we live by our faith and pray with our feet, no one's going to stop us now.", "timestamp": "2004-03-02", "title": "Address to the Greater Bethlehem Temple Church in Jackson, Mississippi"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29668", "text": "We are here tonight to honor our next generation of lawyers and to honor your state's most esteemed jurists, the Iowa Supreme Court. It is a Supreme Court whose history is worthy of celebration. In 1868, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that a girl could not be denied access to her neighborhood school because of the color of her skin. The very next year, this Court ruled that women could not be denied the right to practice law in Iowa. And in 1873, Iowa's high court ruled that an African American woman who was a passenger on a steamboat had the very same rights as the white passengers traveling with her.\nThese decisions were decades ahead of where most of our nation stood when it came to recognizing the rights of all Americans. I hope all of you take great pride in this legacy.\nThirty years ago this fall, I enrolled at Boston College Law School at a time when the nation at large was catching up to some of those early Iowa decisions. I went to law school as part of a generation at the crossroads. Vietnam had tested our faith in institutions and transformed so many of us into activists knocking on doors and raising our voices to hold the system accountable from the outside. We'd seen that the law could be an engine for progress, that barriers could be broken when idealistic citizens gave voice to our fundamental values inside a courtroom. We'd seen Attorney General Bobby Kennedy send the National Guard into hostile territory to face down Bull Connor and his snarling police dogs. We'd read of a brilliant young lawyer by the name of Thurgood Marshall, whose arguments in Brown v. Board of Education led the Supreme Court to strike down a false doctrine of \"separate and unequal.\" We were marching for the ERA in the streets of New York, but we had faith that the law would respond to just impulses because Roe v. Wade had expanded the meaning of equality and freedom for all Americans.\nI went to law school because I believed the struggle for justice I'd seen in the movement against the war could still be advanced in a courtroom. I still believed the law was a way to give power to those who had been denied it and to give a voice to the voiceless. I couldn't wait to put that belief to the test first as a student prosecutor working in the DA's office, and then as an assistant district attorney in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.\nMy faith in the law was reaffirmed. We modernized the district attorney's office and ended a backlog of thousands of cases to deliver justice on time. We took on criminals who preyed on the weakest and most vulnerable members of our society. We helped kids who were abused and neglected. We worked with police who needed to know that we had reformed and revitalized the justice system so the criminals they risked their lives to track down didn't fall through the cracks of a big bureaucracy.\nAnd we helped create one of the nation's first rape crisis crime units - at a time when violence against women was a subject that was often swept under the rug. I remember speaking with the women who would come into our office. The terror they had experienced. The fear that was in their eyes. But most of all, I remember their dignity and determination in the face of the most terrible crimes. It's an every day reminder I carry around with me about why I must do everything in my power to support the rights of women and to take on the cowards that attack our mothers, sisters, and daughters.\nI'm sure that many of the students who are graduating from this law school this year begin their legal career for idealistic reasons of their own. I applaud you and all your fellow students for your dedication to this important profession. Yet, as you no doubt know from your studies, you are beginning your legal careers in a very different era. Instead of paving the path of equality and freedom, too many recent court decisions have served as roadblocks.\nMake no mistake there are many, many wonderful judges sitting on the bench around the country and sitting in this room here tonight. They work everyday in a legal system that is overburdened. They do their level best to implement our laws, make real our Constitution, and protect our rights. They are respected in their communities and sources of pride our country.\nDespite all that, I believe we cannot afford to ignore a disturbing trend in our judicial system. In the past three years, courts have struck down or weakened important sections of the Violence Against Women Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. And they have continued to steadily erode the right to choose.\nThis change in the wind isn't just a natural swing of the pendulum, it isn't a coincidence, and it isn't an accident. It seems instead to be part of a process of politicization in our legal system. This process should concern all of us who look to the courts for justice and wisdom.\nDrake Law School's Supreme Court competition was begun sixty-six years ago, in 1937, with the goal of fostering good relations between the school, the bench, and the bar. At that time, Americans feared that politicians were trying to subvert the independence of the courts. This concern is as important now as it was then. Our courts should never be wholly owned subsidiaries of one political party, one point of view, one ideology, or one President.\nLast year, President Bush told an audience that, \"We've got to get good, conservative judges appointed to the bench and approved by the United States Senate.\" With all due respect, I disagree. I don't believe we need conservative judges or liberal judges or anything but patriotic American judges who will enforce the laws and the Constitution of the United States.\nWhenever one party attempts to turn judicial decisions into political debates, it causes Americans to doubt the independence of the courts and to question their role. But most importantly, it takes important issues out of the realm of legislation and executive actions areas where the people, through their voice and their votes, can exert influence. Instead, crucial choices on policy matters are made by judges acting in a super-legislative capacity. In these instances, the quality of justice for all suffers. But those that suffer most, are those who most need protections and equality. This includes minorities, gays and lesbians. Tonight, I would like to focus my remarks on women and what the politicization of justice means to them and their lives.\nJudicial nominees by the present Administration have records that I believe are troubling to American women and those that support their equal rights. Judges like Charles Pickering and Priscilla Owen have long records of opposition to Roe v. Wade, have sought to restrict laws barring sexual discrimination, have supported a ban on interracial marriage, and have worked to narrow laws on gender discrimination. Nominations to the courts should not be occasions to advance partisan agendas but rather opportunities to advance justice.\nI believe recent judicial decisions and nominations have made American women less safe and less secure - on the job and on the streets. And I believe our government and our legal system needs to be back on the side of women standing up for their security, ensuring their safety, supporting their rights, and guaranteeing their dignity. This nation can do no less.\nI strongly feel that we do not need more judges that embrace the types of views that led the Supreme Court to recently strike down parts of the Americans with Disabilities Act - a landmark piece of bipartisan legislation that is the Civil Rights Bill to those with disabilities and the shining legacy of your great Senator, Tom Harkin. Unfortunately, the Court found that a nurse who had been demoted for missing work because of her breast cancer treatments could not hold her employers accountable for their actions under this act.\nAnd this year, the Court is looking at potentially weakening the Family and Medical Leave Act. I have joined a brief to the Court arguing that this fundamental protection for American women and families should not be undermined.\nOur legal system, of course, extends beyond the courts. Over the course of the past two years, Attorney General Ashcroft has presided over an unfortunate politicization of the Justice Department. Civil rights enforcement has been cut back and anti-domestic violence efforts have been eliminated.\nBut perhaps no decision better symbolizes what judicial politicization means for American women than the decision to strip down the Violence Against Women Act. This piece of legislation told America, \"We will put the power of the federal government on the side of battered women who have had no voice.\" Bonnie Campbell, Iowa's former Attorney General, led the nation in recognizing the terrible toll of violence against women. All Americans owe her a debt of gratitude.\nThe Violence Against Women Act was passed by Republicans and Democrats alike. Not a single member of the House of Representatives voted against it. Yet, the right of women to sue their attackers in federal court was struck down.\nAnd as if that weren't enough, Nancy Pfotenhauer, a strident opponent of the Violence Against Women Act, was appointed to the government body which is charged with guiding the Act's implementation. Pfotenhauer opposed the Violence Against Women Act when it was in Congress and supported the challenge to it at the Supreme Court. Talk about the fox guarding the chicken coop.\nPfotenhauer's organization even claims that - quote - the battered women's movement has outlived its useful beginnings. With studies showing that one in five women will be victims of a rape or attempted rape in the course of their lifetime, I'd say that the fight to prevent violence against women is still in its useful beginnings. We have a long way to go.\nI was proud to help lead the effort in 1994 to create specialized anti-domestic violence efforts through the COPS initiative. And we saw the number of domestic violence incidents drop by about twenty percent in four years. When that type of effort is completely eliminated, I believe it sets us on the wrong track.\nWe need to be concerned about the affirmative action initiatives which millions of American women depend on for justice and fairness. And we must safeguard Title Nine of the Civil Rights Act. Just last week, an Administration commission on Title Nine came back with recommendations that would gut a law that has opened doors for millions of girls and young women. These recommendations have been rejected on a bipartisan basis and for good reason.\nAnd finally there is the issue of choice. This issue is about the right of American women to control their own bodies, their own lives, and their own destinies. It is about their right to make their own decisions in consultation with their doctor, their conscience, and their God.\nAnyone who has talked to or knows a woman who has faced this dilemma knows how difficult, how painful and how lonely it can be. We can't go back to the days of back alleys - days in which women were shamed by the high and mighty and forced to put their lives at risk. We can't put women in the place where their choice is to break the law and be branded a criminal. Women need access to information, to choices, and to their legal rights.\nIt won't surprise you to know I think that elections for Congress and the Presidency are important. But appointments to the bench are just as important - maybe more so. Senators and Presidents come and go. Judges rule for a lifetime. Those of you in law school now could be dealing with the rulings of some of these new judges for most of your legal careers.\nAnd while they only see a tiny percentage of federal cases, there is a reason the Supreme Court is the highest court in the land. It is there that debates are settled, that doctrines are set, and that millions of Americans look for justice and wisdom. In recent years, we have seen a court that has split five to four on important cases. With divisions so great, it is important that the next appointment to the Supreme Court be an individual who can bring consensus, not conflict. At a time of war, the American people have no stomach for another partisan confirmation battle. If a retirement opens up, our discussion should be an occasion to focus on the Constitution and what's right, not on confrontation and wrangling.\nI believe we should work to expand the rights and opportunities for women and help make it is easier to be a good employee and a good parent. We should strengthen and restore the Violence Against Women Act and put the federal government foursquare on the side of women who have been threatened, endangered, and harmed.\nWe should improve the Family and Medical Leave Act to help even more Americans care for their children and their parents. Millions of Americans are struggling to do right by their children and often their aging parents. We need action to help them balance work and family.\nWe should protect Title Nine and its guarantee that women get a fair shake.\nWe should make sure that an equal days pay for an equal days work is a reality and not just a slogan.\nAnd we must ensure that the right to choose is never abridged, never weakened, and never taken away.\nThrough the appointments that are made to important legal positions and through the actions we take, we will make the lives of American women stronger and more secure. Women deserve a government that honors and respects them as individuals and as citizens.\nWhen we discuss laws and courts, judges and decisions, it is sometimes easy to forget what is really at stake. But at its heart, this issue is about more than marble columns and majority opinions, more than black robes and the black letter. It is about women like Christy Brzonkala. Christy was in the September of her first year at Virginia Tech when she stopped by the room of two men one night on her way home from a party. I won't go into the brutal details of what happened next, but it changed Christy's life forever. When she reported to the school that she had been raped, they dithered and then did nothing. So she took the men to court under the Violence Against Women Act. It was her case that the Supreme Court used to turn back that law. Christy and all the other women, and men, of this country look to the courts for justice and they deserve just that.\nSupreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once said that, \"The mark of a good judge is a judge whose opinion you can read and have no idea if the judge was a man or a woman, Republican or Democrat, a Christian or a Jew. You just know he or she was a good judge.\" Those are the kinds of judges we need in American once again. Judges who respect human dignity, protect our rights and liberties, believe in genuine equality. Judges who know that \"Equal Justice Under the Law\" isn't just an inscription, it's a promise. That is a promise that all of you who are here tonight from first year law students to Supreme Court Justices believe in. That is the type of justice - and the type of Justices - that all Americans deserve.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2004-03-08", "title": "Remarks in Des Moines, Iowa"}

And George Bush has made it clear that he's not going to provide it.\nGeorge W. Bush is running on the slogan of ‘steady leadership.' But after four years of the same old failed policies, what we've seen is ‘stubborn leadership.'\nGeorge Bush stubbornly proposes tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest Americans while we steadily lose millions of jobs. So tonight we say: Change is coming to America.\nGeorge Bush stubbornly refuses to help families afford health care while premiums steadily rise through the roof. And tonight we say: Change is coming to America.\nThis President stubbornly continues to let polluters rewrite our environmental laws while children steadily breathe dirtier and dirtier air. Tonight we say: Change is coming to America.\nGeorge Bush stubbornly insists on a foreign policy where we go it alone and young Americans in uniform steadily pay the price. And so once again tonight we say: Change is coming to America.\nThis President's stubborn leadership has steadily led America in the wrong direction – and in November, it's going to lead him out the door.\nWe will set a new direction for America. We will build an economy that creates jobs instead of destroying them. We will finally bring health care costs under control – and at long last make health care in America a right and not a privilege. We will restore fiscal sanity. We truly will leave no child behind. We will lead America toward energy independence from Mideast oil. And we will rejoin the community of nations and renew our alliances because that is essential to waging and winning the war on terror.\nOur opponents can't campaign on jobs, health care, or fiscal responsibility. So now they say they just want to run on national security. But if George Bush wants to make national security the central issue of this election, I have three simple words for him I know he understands: Bring it on.\nThis President doesn't have a record to run on, only a record to run from. So his campaign has already resorted to their old tricks: attack ads and wedge politics.\nThey don't want a great debate on the great issues. So George Bush, who promised to be a uniter, has become the great divider.\nI tell you today: it won't work.\nIn this campaign, I've been reminded of something I first learned as a young man on a Navy boat on the other side of the world – the things that bring us together as Americans are far more powerful than the things that pull us apart.\nThe best lessons I learned about being an American came in a place far away from America – on a gunboat on the Mekong Delta with a band of brothers from all walks of life and every corner of this land. We learned many things on that journey; but above all, we learned that we were no longer the kid from South Carolina or Arkansas or Illinois or the kid from Massachusetts. The differences of color and religion and background melted away and we were united in our shared mission. We were all simply ‘Americans.' All of us fighting under the same flag, praying to the same God.\nWe learned that when we stay together – we stay strong. We didn't think we were special. We just did what we were supposed to do: fight for our country.\nToday, 35 years later, that same principal is what guides all of us who are enlisted in this campaign: We are still fighting for our country. We always have and always will. So the message rings out tonight across our country: Get ready – a new day is on the way.\nGood night. God Bless you. And may God Bless the America that we love.", "timestamp": "2004-03-09", "title": "Remarks Following the Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas Primaries"}

I want to thank you for the great welcome and endorsement in Washington. Never have we needed to work together more effectively and energetically than now. And as I said in Washington: this November, we are going to beat George Bush and get our economy back on track.\nI'm sorry I can't be with you in person. But I'm sure you'd agree that the people here with me today at the Hill Mechanical Group are the folks this election's all about. They don't just build buildings. These workers – and millions like them all over this country – are the people who have built America. And its time they had a President who honors their contribution to this country and gives them the respect they deserve.\nYou know better than anyone that too many Americans work till they're bone tired and still find they can barely make ends meet. They're getting socked from all sides by bills and taxes and tuition costs and health care premiums. And they're working harder just to stay in place.\nAnd all the while, Americans watch as this White House wastes their tax dollars and gives those who cut corners and break laws special benefits while those who do what's right get the short end of the stick. It's not hard to see why so many people think they're working for the economy, but the economy's not working for them.\nThe stakes in this race are enormous. We have to bring back an America that values work and honors working people, day in and day out. That means new leadership that respects the values working people hold dear: sticking up for ourselves, playing by the rules, looking out for each other, a fair break for everybody - not just those with the connections and the cash.\nWe learned the truth of what we believed: George Bush thinks exporting our jobs is good economic policy. I believe we need to create and keep good jobs here and export goods.\nGeorge Bush is the first President since Herbert Hoover to actually lose jobs under his watch. But rain or shine, surplus or deficit, George Bush's economic prescription begins and ends with tax giveaways for those with special pull and special influence.\nI intend to return tax fairness to America. With George Bush's tax cuts, the top one percent of taxpayers have received almost forty percent of the breaks. Meanwhile middle class working people have seen their share of the tax burden go up, not down.\nIf you add up the true costs of this President's economic policies, you get a Bush Tax of higher property taxes, higher fees, higher health care costs – at the same time middle class incomes are going down. In thirty-two states, state and local property taxes have gone up. This Bush Tax can take thirty-five hundred dollars or more from the pockets of America's middle class. And they can't afford that price.\nGeorge Bush is running on the same-old Republican tactics of fear – and they're already getting tired. But we have something better than attacks, we have the facts. And here they are: Under George Bush's policies, middle class families are paying more. America's middle class can't afford a tax increase. That's why we're going to give the middle class a tax cut.\nI am going to ask America's wealthiest people – those making over $200,000 a year – to pay the same fair share they paid under Bill Clinton. Back then the rich got richer – but everyone else did too. By rolling back the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, we can start to restore fiscal responsibility and invest in education and health care for our people. We also need to shut the loopholes that force American workers to subsidize sending jobs overseas!\nOur middle class tax cut will help working people afford college and pay for health care and make ends meet. If this President wants to make this election about taxes after he's cut billions for billionaires and given middle-class families a larger share to pay, we're ready for that fight.\nThis President promised that his tax cuts would create 4 million new jobs – so far he's only 7 million short. So it's no surprise that his only real proposal to create new jobs is to make his tax cuts permanent. But as the Laborers members there will tell you: when you're 7 million jobs in the hole, step number one is pretty simple: stop digging.\nJust the other week, he promised us that he'd create 2.6 million new jobs this year alone. But his own Treasury secretary told us that wasn't true, his own Commerce secretary told us that wasn't true, and yesterday, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office put out an official report saying his new round of tax giveaways wouldn't create new jobs.\nIt must be getting lonely for George Bush. It seems he's the last person left in America who actually believes his failed policies will ever work\nWe've all heard the old saying, \"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.\" But we've also heard the saying that goes, \"take a hint.\" This President stubbornly refuses to admit his policies aren't working and to change course. And that's why this November the American people will chart a new course for our nation.\nYou and your members know better than anyone that America is hurting. Everywhere I've been in this campaign, I've met working Americans who are getting the short end of the stick. Jobs on the run. Wages and salaries dead in the water. Bankruptcies and foreclosures at record highs.\nBut all the pain I've seen doesn't hold a candle to the power of the confidence and hope that everyday Americans have in the future of our country.\nWe're going to harness that spirit to give America a new beginning.\nWe will create new incentives to help companies create and keep new jobs here at home. If I'm President our government won't provide a single reward for sending our jobs overseas, or exploiting the tax code to go to Bermuda to avoid paying taxes while sticking the American people with the bill.\nWe're going to invest in our people again – in their training and skills and in raising the minimum wage so that working people can make ends meet.\nWe're going to make health care affordable for our families and our small businesses and hold down the soaring costs of health insurance and prescription drugs. If I'm President, we will end the days when working people have to negotiate away wage increases just to keep their health care.\nAnd I'm going to stand up and insist that trade mean fairness for workers – not a free ride for those that break the rules. This Administration has let foreign countries break the rules and walk all over us.\nAs I've said to you many times I will fight for real worker and environmental provisions in the core of every trade agreement. And I'll order an immediate 120 day review of all existing trade agreements to ensure our trading partners are living up to their labor and environmental obligations.\nJust a few months ago, this Administration said they opposed efforts to increase the funds for enforcing China's trade agreements. They said the money was just \"unnecessary.\" I'll tell you what is necessary – a President who will put American workers first.\nAnd we're going to join the fight to bring basic fairness back to our workplaces. I will stand up for safe workplaces and the right to organize, especially through petitions and card checks. I will protect collective bargaining rights. And I will stop any effort to eliminate the 40-hour work week and overtime dead in its tracks.\nWe know what this President is offering to America: the politics of blame – and a promise of more of the same. It's clear George Bush will fight like hell to keep his own job, but he won't lift a finger to help Americans keep theirs. I'm running for President to put America back to work.\nI know the fight for jobs, the fight for affordable health care, the fight for trade policies that work for America won't be easy. But I've been in tough fights before. For 35 years, I've fought for my country and for people. And I'm ready to lead the battle for our jobs and our economic future.\nI say to all of you and all of America: get ready, a new day is on the way.", "timestamp": "2004-03-10", "title": "Remarks on Tax Policy"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29671", "text": "One Wednesday afternoon in 1858, Quincy was transformed. Twenty thousand people gathered here in what was a town of ten thousand. They came from miles around to see Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas take part in the sixth of seven debates about the fateful issues of that time.\nBoth candidates laid out their positions plainly and honestly. They clashed – but over differences in policy, not personal attacks.\nThis state – and this country – was energized by election campaigns in those days. After the Quincy debate, thousands lit torches and paraded through the town – singing and cheering into the night.\nBut today, campaigns too often generate more heat than light – firing up partisans while leaving increasing numbers out in the cold. Candidates find it easier to exchange insults than to face issues. Commentators and pollsters tell us who's up and who's down. On television, talking heads talk and yell past one another. Six-second sound-bites on the evening news and thirty-second attack ads all day long dominate the airwaves.\nEveryone in politics shares the blame. But I have come here today, because I believe this campaign should be different. President Bush and I can do better – and America deserves better. And so here, in Quincy, where long ago we saw the best of American politics, I am asking George Bush to agree to a series of monthly debates, stating this spring. This should be a campaign worthy of the great issues before us, a campaign that truly can give the election of America's president back to America's people.\nIn recent years, we have seen just how easily our politics can descend into a battle over the lowest common denominator. When he first began running for President, George Bush promised that he'd \"change the tone in Washington\" – that he'd bring a kinder, gentler politics of \"respect and bipartisanship.\"\nBut in South Carolina, John McCain's sacrifice as a POW was used to attack his fitness to serve as Commander-in-Chief. In 2002, an America hero, Max Cleland – who lost three limbs in Vietnam – was defeated for reelection to the Senate with ads that questioned his patriotism and his commitment to our national security.\nAfter 9-11, the American people hoped Washington would put away the old ways of slash-and-burn. The people themselves rallied – not to any party – but to the cause of country at a time of peril. Now, it is time for George Bush and me to offer the American people a campaign that honors the best in America.\n2004 can't be just another year of politics-as-usual. The challenges we face are just too great and too grave. Every minute that passes, we're losing two jobs and adding a million dollars to our national debt. In the past three years, three million more Americans have slipped into poverty and four million more are uninsured. And two and a half years after September 11th, our firefighters are getting laid off, our troops have been left without body armor, and potential allies in the War on Terror have been pushed away. We confront big issues – as big as any in our history – and they call for a new and historic commitment to a real and informed exchange of ideas.\nAlready, the Bush campaign has started airing their long-trumpeted negative attack ads. And our campaign has answered to set the record straight. But America shouldn't have to put up with eight months of sniping. We need to get off that detour, and back onto the true path of democracy.\nWe will have disagreements. And we should discuss them. I think the Bush tax giveaway for the wealthy is a mistake and an injustice. And I believe that money could be better used to finally get health care costs under control. But let's debate that issue instead of falsely suggesting that I want to raise taxes on all Americans – when in fact I have proposed to cut taxes on the middle class.\nLet's stop implying that either of us doesn't want to defend our nation – and start talking about the best way to do it.\nPresident Bush was gracious enough to call me on Super Tuesday to offer his congratulations. I told him then, what I have said here, that I hope we will have a great debate on the issues that will determine America's future. I meant it. That's why today, I am asking the President to join me in committing ourselves to a series of monthly debates where we can present our two visions to the people for their judgment. Surely, if the attack ads can start now, at least, we can agree to start a real discussion about America's future.\nGeorge Bush and I certainly aren't Stephen Douglas or Abraham Lincoln, but I believe the American people are hungry for a genuine conversation about the fundamental questions before us – and they are ready to begin this now instead of postponing it for later in the campaign.\nI have some personal experience with this. In 1996, I ran for reelection against Bill Weld, the very popular Republican governor of Massachusetts. Everyone expected it would be a knock-down, drag-out mud bath. And we did have our share of rough-and-tumble politics.\nBut we did something else too. From April to October, we took part in a series of eight debates all across the state. I have to admit, when I first decided to do it, I wondered if voters could actually take the cruel and unusual punishment of having to listen to two politicians for that long.\nBut something happened along the way. From the start, polls showed that almost half the viewers in Massachusetts watched the debates. By the time voters went to the polls, everyone knew where we stood and what we would do. And after the election was over, Bill Weld and I were still able to get together for a beer at a local bar, pull up a stool together, and shake hands as friends.\nI believe America is ready for that kind of democracy in 2004. I believe America needs and deserves it now more than ever.\nThe morning after the Quincy debate, Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln boarded a steamer at dawn to head to the next debate. But their impact and influence lives on here in Quincy and across America.\nIt was almost a hundred years later that President Kennedy and Barry Goldwater looked forward to running against one another in the 1964 campaign. They planned to fly around, maybe in the same airplane, and debate all across the country. A single moment in Dallas shattered that dream and so many others. But it doesn't have to have died for good.\nAfter the last Lincoln-Douglas debate ended, the Rockford Republican wrote, \"These debates are now closed, and the people, ...having heard the two opposing champions and candidates...have been able to judge between the merits of their respective positions ...and their abilities as statesmen.\" We can renew that bond of trust with the American people in the election of 2004.\nMaybe George Bush and I won't travel on the same boat or on the same airplane. But we can give this country a campaign that genuinely addresses our real issues and treats voters with respect.\nAnd who knows, maybe after it's all over, George Bush and I will be able to sit down together at a Red Sox-Rangers game and shake hands as friends. And that would be an election where all Americans would win in the end.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2004-03-13", "title": "Remarks in Quincy, Illinois"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29672", "text": "I can't begin what we need to talk about today without two words: thank you. You were there with me through thick and thin. When the going was tough. On the coldest days in Iowa and New Hampshire. Through this long journey you have shown what we always knew was true: firefighters can take the heat.\nYou stood with me through all the ups and downs - and I will stand with you for all the days to come. Because our goal is not just victory in November. It is the day when every firefighter gets the equipment and support they need - and the respect and honor they've earned. And we will not rest for one moment until we get there.\nAs we talk about where the Bush Administration hasn't spent the money they need to on security, I have to say a few words about another instance of this Administration wasting our tax dollars. Today we find out they have been using government money to pay for campaign-style videos to sell their Medicare bill. They know that their Medicare bill does more for drug companies than seniors. So they've hired actors to pose as journalists to sell a bad bill with your money. After already hiring actors to pose as soldiers in the President's campaign commercials, you have to kind of wonder: how many Oscar-winning performances will it take to convince America that George Bush can put America back on track?\nWhen President Bush fought to push through his Medicare plan last November, he promised the American people that it would cost $395 billion. Yet, only two months later the Administration said they now realized the plan would cost $135 billion more than the President had promised.\nNow we learn the shocking truth: that they knew it all along. And even worse, the government's top expert on Medicare costs had been told to keep quiet - or pay the price. There is no place for silencing the truth. I believe the American people deserve real answers on why this Administration is keeping public officials quiet and keeping facts from the American people. We deserve better than this.\nCourage is a word that gets thrown around a lot sometimes. But it doesn't mean anything unless there is a danger that is real. None of you here needs to be reminded of this. But this past week, all of us received heartbreaking reminders nonetheless.\nWe join together in mourning the loss of Charles Brace and Richard Stefanakis and pray for the speedy recovery of the 29 other firefighters injured at the blaze in the Ebenezer Church. Today, that ground has been made even holier by their brave sacrifice. And what they did - and what they represented - will never be forgotten.\nAnd we also mourn the loss of Mike Miller of New Hampshire who died in an underwater training exercise. I visited his firehouse in Laconia during this campaign and my heart goes out to his family and his comrades.\nWe meet today while our nation is at war. The War on Terror is being fought in distant parts of the world - and in the very neighborhoods we call home. One year ago, I came here to say that the most basic responsibility of government is to provide for the common defense. But that thus far the Bush Administration had \"provided too little support, provided too little leadership, and provided too little vision for the common defense of our homeland.\" One year later we gather again - and the same is true. Whether it has been providing funding and equipment for firefighters, ensuring that cargo in our ports is screened, guarding our chemical and nuclear facilities, or working with local communities across the country to give them the resources they need - this Administration has given our homeland security efforts short shrift. And you deserve better.\nI do not fault George Bush for doing too much in the War on Terror; I believe he's done too little. When the focus of the War on Terror was appropriately in Afghanistan and on breaking al Qaeda, President Bush shifted his focus to Iraq and Saddam Hussein. He's pushed away our allies at a time when we need them most. He hasn't pursued a strategy to win the hearts and minds of people around the world and win the war of ideas against the radical ideology of Osama bin Laden. And time and again, George Bush has failed to give those fighting the War on Terror - whether they're overseas or over here - the weapons, equipment, and support they need.\nIn dangerous parts of Iraq, our helicopters are flying missions without the best available anti-missile systems. Un-armored Humvees are falling victim to road-side bombs and small-arms fire and the Bush Administration waited through month after month of ambushes to act.\nAnd tens of thousands of other troops arrived in Iraq to find that - with danger around every corner - there wasn't enough body armor to protect them. Many of their families on the homefront - mothers and fathers, husbands and wives and children - were forced to raise the money to buy it for them. Families should be sending pictures and care packages to Iraq - and the Department of Defense should be sending the body armor. Today, I call on President Bush to support a law now in Congress to reimburse each and every family who had to buy the body armor this Administration failed to provide.\nMany of us here today have been on the frontlines of conflicts far away. But all of us know that today firefighters and other first defenders here at home are on the frontlines of this new war - and you also deserve the tools you need to do the job.\nAfter September 11th, President Bush went to New York, stood at Ground Zero, and stood with our firefighters. I wish the President would go back now and ask whether he's stood with you since that day.\nYou should never have to worry about getting the health benefits and collective bargaining rights you've earned. And President Bush should never forget that the three hundred forty-three heroes we lost on 9-11 were not only parents and children, brothers and husbands, fiancees and best friends. They were also proud members of Locals 94 and 854. They never forgot it and neither will we.\nTwo and a half years after 9-11, fire departments only have enough radios for half their firefighters and almost two-thirds of firehouses are short-staffed - with more firefighters and police officers being laid off.\nCargo in our airports and seaports still isn't getting screened. Our terrorist watch lists haven't been simplified and the right information still isn't available to the right people on the frontlines of preventing the next attack. First defenders still can't radio each other in emergency situations. Air marshals are being laid off.\nAnd yet this Administration has put a tax giveaway for the very wealthiest over making sure we do all we can to win the War on Terror here at home. They have no problem giving Halliburton a fat no-bid contract while only soldiers and firefighters and police officers are asked to give their sacrifice.\nI think this Administration has it backwards. President Bush says we can't afford to fund homeland security. I say we can't afford not to. When it comes to protecting America from terrorism, this Administration is big on bluster and short on action. But as we saw again last week in Spain - real action is what we need.\nThe Bush Administration is tinkering while the clock on homeland security is ticking. And we don't have a moment to waste.\nThat means truly dedicating ourselves to homeland security - not using it as a political prop. For months this Administration stubbornly refused to allow a Department of Homeland Security - and then shifted course when the pressure mounted. But since then, they've used the Department of Homeland Security to track down state legislators in Texas. And this week, we learn from Time Magazine that the Department's employees have been asked to provide President Bush with a homeland security photo-op every month.\nAmerica doesn't need leaders who play politics with 9-11 or see the War on Terror as just another campaign issue. Our nation's safety is too important. If I am President, we will work toward victory in the War on Terror knowing that those on the frontlines of this battle are heroes, not political props. That the needs of our first defenders will never be left for last.\nHere's what we will do:\nWe will pass the SAFER Firefighters Act, fund the FIRE Act, and create the Father Mychal Judge Fund to hire 100,000 new firefighters across America.\nWe will direct assistance to the frontlines. So that local firefighters and other first defenders don't have to settle for the left-overs that filter down to them through layer upon layer of bureaucracy. When we passed the COPS program ten years ago to put 100,000 police officers on the beat, it took just 62 days for the first grants to local communities. Today, towns and cities all over America are still waiting for the homeland security funds for purchasing equipment and providing training that they've been promised for years.\nAnd while we're at it, we will restore the COPS funds President Bush eliminated. We should be putting more cops on the beat not laying them off.\nWe will reduce the spread of nuclear and biological and chemical weapons and better guard our ports. We will provide frontline defenders with the gear and communications equipments and intelligence they need. We will make sure our public health system is ready for whatever comes its way. And we will enlist the American people and make sure they are part of our efforts to make the land we share safer from those opposed to our democracy and way of life.\nI'm not saying this will all be easy. But none of you here has signed up for an easy life. And none of you signed up to be on the frontlines of a new war. But, day after day, firefighters get the job done. You deserve a President who joins you in that effort - not just when the cameras are clicking or the political season heats up. But a President who goes to the Oval Office every morning knowing that his job is to help you do yours. And that's the kind of President I will be.\nYou have already done so much - but we have just yet begun to fight. Together we will take our message of change - of a strong America - to every corner of America. To all the places and all the people that want leadership that lives by and honors mainstream values. And leadership that makes our people safe and secure. That's not too much to ask for. But right here, right now, together, we are making this pledge: that's what we will deliver.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2004-03-15", "title": "\"Supporting America's Front Lines of the War on Terror\": Remarks of John Kerry"}

America deserves more than a debate full of attacks and distortions. The times are too serious and the challenges we face too great. Instead, this campaign should be a great debate about how we're going to restore hope and opportunity and a better future for our people.\nOn all the key concerns facing America – from job creation, to health care costs, to getting our deficit under control, to repairing our friendships and alliances across the world, I believe we can do better. I believe a new course will yield a better result. I believe America must move in a new direction.\nAs we begin this general election, there is one message that I want all Americans to hear – and the friends and enemies of America need to know. When it comes to protecting the security of our nation and winning the war on terror, America is unified.\nWe may disagree on how best to achieve that security, but no matter what the outcome of this election, we will stand as one country when it comes to protecting the safety of our people.\nFor many months and over many miles, we have traveled across this great land. From snow to sunshine, we have heard the same message time and again: On the pocketbook issues facing ordinary Americans, we must set a new course for our country.\nAnd that is what we will do. A jobless recovery is no recovery at all. The economic policies that our leadership has in place today have not worked, are not working, and will not work. We need a new economic policy – one that puts an end to wasteful tax giveaways to the wealthiest Americans; one that provides new incentives for manufacturing companies to keep jobs here. We need a new economic direction, one that exerts presidential leadership on behalf of America's jobs.\nAnd that's one thing we know how to do: Create jobs. We did it all through the 1990s. It wasn't that long ago that we pursued an economic strategy that helped to create over 20 million new jobs and brought record surpluses to America. We can do it again – but that means ending a failing economic strategy and turning to a new approach.\nWe need a new policy on health care. The current approach to our health care crisis has not worked, is not working, and will not work. I have proposed a new strategy that will finally get health care costs under control. We cannot allow a system to continue where parents fear the cost of health care for their children, where hard working people watch health care premiums rise out of reach, where drug companies make bigger and bigger profits while more and more people go without insurance or the prescription medicine they need. The time has come to make health care a right, and not a privilege.\nWe need to restore fiscal sanity to America's budget. Every day, the deficit gets worse and worse. Now it's at the point where a child born today is inheriting a $30,000 debt that he or she had no part in creating. It's not only our children who are shouldering the burden; these deficits threaten the fiscal solvency of Social Security and Medicare. There is nothing conservative – and nothing responsible – about the reckless runaway deficits being created today in this country. Once again, it was our strategy that worked to get the nation's deficit under control – and we will do it again.\nWe also need to meet one of the great challenges of our time: energy independence. We have talked about meeting this goal for over 30 years in America – and we can no longer wait to do it. I have proposed a bold new plan for energy independence that will invest in the technologies of the future and create 500,000 new jobs in the process – so no young American in uniform will ever have to go to war for Mideast oil.\nAnd we must repair our friendships and alliances around the world. We are safer and stronger when we don't go it alone. As President, I will lead the effort to rejoin the community of nations – because we should always fight for an America that is once again respected for its might, but admired for its ideals.\nFor more than 35 years, I have fought for my country. And that is exactly what I intend to do as President. And in this campaign I have been reminded of something I learned as a young man on a Navy boat on the other side of the world: that what holds us together as Americans is so much more powerful than what divides us.\nEverywhere I have been in America, I have seen the yearning for a new direction for our country. I've heard it in town meetings. I've seen it in the eyes of a middle aged couple where a husband lost his job – and his wife, who has breast cancer, has to keep working through her chemotherapy to keep her health insurance. I have listened to families ask why they had to pay for body armor for sons and daughters on the frontlines in Iraq.\nI promise to be a President who fights for them – and for you. I promise to unite our country, not divide it. And then, with your help, we're going to have an economic plan that creates jobs, a health care plan that gets costs under control, and a plan for energy independence. And we're going to restore America's true leadership in the world.\nI am running for President not simply to oppose what is wrong, but to set this nation on a new course. Together, in the months ahead, we will call on the best in Americans – and stand up for the best America. We will give America back its future and its truth.\nI say to you tonight: A new day is on the way.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2004-03-16", "title": "Remarks Following the Illinois Primary"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29674", "text": "One year ago this week, American soldiers raced across the desert to Baghdad. Ten months ago, George Bush stood on an aircraft carrier and proclaimed \"mission accomplished.\"\nBut today we know that the mission is not finished, hostilities have not ended, and our men and women in uniform fight on almost alone with the target squarely on their backs. Everyday, they face danger and death from suicide bombers, roadside bombers, and now ironically, from the very Iraqi police they are training.\nWe are still bogged down in Iraq - and the Administration stubbornly holds to failed policies that drive potential allies away. What we have seen is a steady loss of lives and mounting costs in dollars, with no end in sight.\nWe were misled about weapons of mass destruction. We are misled now when the costs of Iraq are not even counted in the President's budget. But having gone to war, we have a responsibility to keep and a national interest to achieve in a stable and peaceful Iraq. To leave too soon would leave behind a failed state that inevitably would become a haven for terrorists and a threat to our future, a problem for the Middle East, and a dangerous setback in the war against terror.\nBut the answer is not a stubborn pursuit of the same arrogant policies; the answer to failure is not more of the same. Instead we must return more effectively to the international community, and share the authority and the burdens with other nations. We need to use the tools of diplomacy as well as the tools of war. All of us support our troops. But if we had built a true coalition, they would not have to fight almost alone - and Americans would not have to bear almost all the costs in Iraq. This President is so committed to tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that he refused to ask them to sacrifice even a small portion of that tax cut to give our soldiers the weapons and equipment they need.\nThe lesson here is fundamental: At times, conflict comes, and the decision must be made. For a President, the decision may be lonely, but that does not mean that America should go it alone.\nAnd while we should seek allies, we must never give anyone else a veto over our national security. At this decisive time in our history, when we confront ongoing challenges in Afghanistan as well as Iraq - and the mortal challenge of those that would use terror as a weapon and religion as a shield, there is no greater imperative for a President than the Constitution's command to provide for the common defense. If I am President of the United States, we will do whatever it takes to ensure that the 21st century American military is the strongest in the world. I will not hesitate to use force when it is needed to wage and win the War on Terror.\nAt the heart of that force must be a fully prepared, fully equipped, fully staffed, state-of-the-art military ready to face any adversary, anywhere. Four years ago, George Bush said that our troops lacked the support they needed. Four years ago, he promised them: \"Help is on the way.\" He sent that message to the same military that had been built up in the 1990s and was soon to perform so brilliantly in Afghanistan and Iraq. Well, I say this today: George Bush can't have it both ways. He can't decry the military's readiness in 2000 and then take credit for its success in 2001, before he even passed his first defense budget. Now, in 2004, our armed forces are more extended than at any time in a generation -- and at this time, they are still waiting for help.\nTwenty-five hundred of them are still waiting for medical care. Helicopter pilots have flown battlefield missions without the best available anti-missile systems. Civil Affairs personnel, almost all of them reservists, are stretched to the breaking point, building schools and hospitals. Unarmored Humvees roll toward the next perilous turn in the road. The 428th Transportation Company had to ask local businesses back home to donate the steel to armor their vehicles, and when this President heard about it, instead of saying, \"never again,\" he said, \"good idea.\" And tens of thousands of troops were deployed to Iraq without the most advanced bullet proof vests that can literally make the difference between life and death. Lives and blood will always be the cost of war, but we should never send young American's into harm's way more exposed to danger than they have to be.\nThis President has had his chance; and this President has not delivered.\nSo, let me say here today, to every soldier and every soldier's family: This time help is on the way, and it won't be coming from George Bush.\nIf I am President, never again will parents or husbands or wives of soldiers have to send them body armor instead of photographs and care packages. Last month a young newlywed in Virginia who, as her husband was about to ship out to Iraq, gave him a bullet proof vest for Valentine's Day. I can tell you right now: in a Kerry Administration, no one will be getting body armor as a gift from a loved one; it will come from the Armed Forces of the United States of America. We will supply our troops with everything they need -- and we will reimburse each and every family who has had to buy body armor because this Administration made Valentine's Day part of the procurement process.\nOur military is about much more than moving pins on a map or amassing expensive new weapon systems. A strong military depends first of all on the courage of the men and women who stand a post or go out on patrol in places around the globe and who carry on every day until the mission is accomplished for real. We need a Commander-in-Chief who honors and supports them, for real; a Commander-in-Chief who repays their risks on the battlefield by providing them with the best weapons and protections as they go into battle, a Commander-in-Chief who recognizes their commitment and sacrifice, and offers their families a decent life here at home.\nTo all of the military families who are here today, we say thank you. And to my fellow veterans, the band of brothers who have been with me for so long and to whom I owe so much, I pledge that unlike the time when we fought side by side, I will be a President who does what's right for our men and women in uniform.\nI will never forget that our true power is measured not only by the strength of our weapons, but by the spirit of our soldiers.\nTo me, that is not just rhetoric; it is the reality I lived - and it is central to the work of my life. So I come here today to propose a Military Family Bill of Rights - real and specific guarantees - that will keep faith with those who served and the families who share in their sacrifice.\nOur military families have the right to expect real leadership of the armed forces from the Commander-in-Chief. They have a right to competitive pay and quality housing, decent health care and dental care. Quality education for their children. First rate training. The best possible weaponry and state-of-the-art equipment. They have a right to timely deployment information. And they have a right to know that, in the event of tragedy, help will be there to care and provide for their families and for them.\nAmerica needs a President who will do all that it takes to create the most modern fighting force on earth. When the 4th Infantry Division found Saddam Hussein, they had an unmatched wealth of knowledge about their surroundings and they were connected in an unprecedented way to their commanders. They're known as the \"digital division,\" transformed in the Clinton Administration, when the decision was made to outfit the 4th Division with the latest advances in information technology. Their vehicles in the field have keyboards and touch screen monitors so that troops can access real time maps, track battlefield movements, and even send commands by e-mail. We need to do this across the board. We need to revolutionize our military capability. Our enemies don't use the old tactics and -strategies -- neither should we.\nOur emphasis has do be on empowering soldiers to fight more precisely, on reducing the incidents of friendly-fire and on building a military fit for the future, not the past. That means pushing technology down to the smallest units. When we took on the Taliban, precision bombs onboard planes flying from aircraft carriers in the Indian Ocean were guided to their targets by U.S. Special Forces riding horses across the hills of Afghanistan. They could do that because of what we did to strengthen the military in the last decade, but there is so much more to do. By pushing real-time information, and the ability to take action, into the hands of those closest to the frontlines, we can prepare ourselves for the perils and possibilities of the years ahead.\nThe war in Iraq taught us that a lightning-fast information-age military can drive to Baghdad in three weeks, but the instability that follows requires a large force -- and we cannot rely on reservists alone to make up the difference. I propose to add 40,000 troops to the regular Army, not to send to Iraq, but to ease the burden on troops who have been deployed from one global hot spot to the next with no end in sight. This doesn't mean we have to spend more on the military; instead, we have to be smarter about what we spend by shifting priorities within the defense budget, and scaling back some programs that do more for defense contractors than for the national defense.\nWe are weaker today militarily than we should be, but this Administration stubbornly refuses to admit it. Soldiers in Iraq are paying the price everyday because our forces are spread too thin. There simply aren't enough of them to provide a prudent reserve of active-duty troops to respond if they have to in other hotspots. More than 180,000 members of the National Guard and Reserves are on active duty. Stop-loss programs have kept more than 30,000 troops in the ranks after their enlistments expired. If I am President, I will instruct my Secretary of Defense to conduct a long-range review of the nation's military force structure. And until that review is completed, I will not appoint a Base Closure Commission.\nWe should not begin that work until we are clear that we are not wasting resources on excess bases, and until we know what our future needs will be at home and around the world.\nAnd as we expand the size of the active-duty Army, we must also recognize that more numbers alone are not enough. The threats of terrorism and the conflicts of the future can only be met with more engineers, more military police, more psychological warfare personnel and civil affairs teams - more special operations forces and more training for peace keeping missions. We need a force that is as well prepared, well-trained, and well-equipped to stabilize a failed state as it is to wage war in an open desert or on urban streets.\nAmerica's strength is not found in our military alone, but in every area of American life. In small towns and cities across this country, there are judges, public administrators, educators, economists, civil engineers, and public safety professionals. They represent a vast untapped reserve of citizens capable - and I believe willing - to make their contribution to national security. It is time to marshal their skills and experience in service to America. They are an army unto themselves; and today I propose that we enlist thousands of them in a Civilian Stability Corps, a reserve organization of volunteers ready to help win the peace in troubled places.\nLike military reservists, they will have peacetime jobs; but in times of national need, they will be called into service to restore roads, renovate schools, open hospitals, repair power systems, draft a constitution, or build a police force. A Civilian Stability Corps can bring the best of America to the worst of the world -- and reduce pressure on the military.\nYet in the end, at the core of our defense are the men in women who wear the uniform, their families, and all those who I call my brothers and sisters, the veterans of this nation. Their concerns are as critical to our strength as the weapons systems we buy or the troop numbers we deploy. We have a sacred obligation to do our part for those who have borne the burdens of battle. This is about the character of our nation and who we are as a people; it is about keeping America's promise, about love of country, and the debt we owe to those who defend it.\nAmerica entered into a covenant with those it drafted and those who enlisted, but the truth is that, with every story of a veteran who goes without adequate health care every day, that covenant is broken. There are countless veterans who fought our wars who are now fighting year after year for the benefits they earned. Last year they had to defeat a Bush Administration proposal to increase fees and co-payments, which was nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt drive an additional one million veterans from the VA health care system. The President then came back with a plan to drive 500,000 from the system by 2005. And then he submitted a similar proposal this year.\nIf I am President, as part of a Military Families Bill of Rights, we will fully fund veterans health and veterans benefits - and our veterans will no longer be the neglected soldiers of America.\nAnd we have to secure the rights not only of those who served in the past, but of patriots all across this country who serve today - in the active duty military, the Reserves, or the National Guard.\nTwenty-percent of our Reservists and their families don't have health care coverage. But George Bush threatened to veto funding for Iraq if it included more money for health care for Reservists, and then tried to cut the pay of soldiers in the field and school aid for children of military families. If I am President, our men and women in uniform will get the benefits they deserve.\nThis Administration also attempted to cut family separation allowances, imminent danger pay, and impact aid -- the help local schools depend on to give military kids the best possible education. I will protect them all -- and as President, I will sign legislation to provide for those families who suffer a loss in war and to protect the livelihood of reservists who are called up and have to leave their jobs. This legislation will include $250,000 on top of their present life insurance policies for all service members who die in the line of duty.\nI will honor the family members of those who fall in service not just with words, but with deeds. People like Cyndi Stever and her ten year old daughter Nichole. When Tony Stever was killed by enemy fire in Iraq last April, Cyndi said she felt she had lost her whole life. But more loss was to come - not just from an enemy, but from her own government. Not long after she buried her husband, Cyndi was told she and Nichole would have to leave their home. Military housing - they were told - is for military families. And since Tony made the ultimate sacrifice, they were no longer a military family.\nHow can this happen in the United States of America? It's not right to tell a family that has just received that knock on the door, \"Oh, by the way - you have to pack up your home and move.\" Move where? Who among us thinks it's right to say such a thing? Who among us could move on short notice when you don't even know where your paycheck will come from? If this Administration says we can afford to throw massive tax cuts at the wealthiest Americans, then don't tell us to throw bereaved military families out of their homes without a chance to pull life back together.\nSo the Military Family Bill of Rights, will allow the spouses and children of those killed in action to remain in military housing for up to a year after the loss of a loved one. It will offer help to move on to a new life. It will provide one year of pay to military dependents of soldiers killed in action. It will make permanent increases in family separation allowances, and permanent guarantees of reservist access to military healthcare. For reservists who are called up, it will also permit penalty free withdrawals from their IRAS to cover the unexpected expenses of lengthy activations and deployments. This is the least we can do for those who give the most they can to our country.\nTo me, guaranteeing these rights and organizing our armed forces accordingly is personal; it is in my soul and it's been a large part of my life. This commitment goes back more than 35 years to the years of my own service. It was then that I learned, together with some of you here today, about our obligations to each other and our country's obligation to those in uniform. And since then, from the struggle for care in our VA hospitals, to post-traumatic stress disorder, to Agent Orange, to the battle for military strength and military pay, to the struggle for answers as we kept faith with our obligations to find the truth about POW/MIA, I have tried to be a voice and a champion for those in uniform who serve our country.\nI make this simple pledge: If I am President, I will fight for a constant standard of decency and respect for those who serve their country in our armed forces - on active duty and as veterans. It should be no other way and if I am president, it will be no other way.", "timestamp": "2004-03-17", "title": "\"Protecting Our Military Families in Times of War\": Remarks of John Kerry"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29675", "text": "Thank you for an unbelievable welcome.\nI want to start by saying something nice about President Bush. Of all the Presidents we've had with the last name of Bush, his economic plan ranks in the top two.\nThis has been an amazing journey. And I never could have made it without my wife Teresa. So many people from Iowa and New Hampshire on got to know her for the down-to-earth, nurturing person she is – and with your help, America will come to know her as a great First Lady.\nPresident Clinton – you brought our Party back to the White House and our nation back to economic greatness – because instead of destroying jobs you created them – 23 million new jobs for America while Bill Clinton was President.\nPresident Carter – you set the standard for human rights. And you had a vision of alternative and renewable energy that we must fulfill so that no young American in uniform should ever have to fight and die because of our dependence on Mideast oil.\nAl Gore – you should have been inaugurated as well as elected President – your example during those post-election weeks four years ago showed us that there is a higher standard than the smash and smear tactics of those determined to win at any price. Ask anyone in this country if they would trade the Bush economy for the Clinton-Gore years and the answer is -- \"yes.\" This year, our opponents don't have a record to run on, but only a record to run from – so they've turned to the old negative politics. I pledge to you here tonight: We're going to fight back and we're going to win in the right way – that lifts our country up instead of driving our politics down to the lowest common denominator.\nAnd let me thank our tireless Chairman, Terry McAuliffe, for making it possible for us to hold this Unity Dinner so early in this election year.\nI feel especially strengthened tonight by the support of those who were recently my competitors but always my friends. Each of them fierce and passionate advocates for causes that define our party – and our country.\nCarol Moseley Braun...\nWes Clark...\nHoward Dean...\nJohn Edwards...\nDick Gephardt...\nBob Graham...\nJoe Lieberman...\nAl Sharpton...\nI am personally grateful for what they have taught me during this process – and far more, we are, all of us, grateful for what they gave the nation in this primary campaign.\nNever has the Democratic Party been more united than it is today.\nAnd tonight, not just as Democrats, but as Americans, we are united in the belief that America deserves better than a debate full of attacks and distortions.\nThe times are too serious and the stakes are too great. And this campaign should be a great debate about how we're going to restore hope and opportunity and the best future for our people.\nAgain and again on the economy, we have heard false promises and easy reassurance. But for real people living real lives in this country, a jobless recovery is no recovery at all. The economic policies in place today have not worked, are not working, and will not work. Over the last four years, the middle class's share of the tax burden has gone up while wages have gone down. Our present leadership believes that those who have the most do not have to do their part to make America stronger. We believe that underestimates the American people and what they are willing to do for our country. Americans deserve better – we know better – and these aren't just words. We need to restore a worker's ability to get ahead in return for hard work. We need to stand up for the right to organize. We need to make the tax code fair. We need to provide middle class tax relief. We need a new economic policy that puts an end to wasteful tax cuts for the wealthy – and offers new incentives for manufacturing companies to create and keep good jobs here at home.\nLet me tell you: that's one thing we know how to do – create jobs. With President Clinton, we not only created those 23 million new jobs; we turned vast budget deficits into record surpluses for America that could have and should have been used to protect Medicare and Social Security.\nNow we need to restore sanity to America's budget. Every day the deficit gets worse and worse. It's at the point where a child born today is inheriting a $35,000 debt that he or she had no part in creating. There is nothing conservative – noting mainstream – and nothing responsible – about the reckless runaway deficits now being created in this country. It was our strategy that worked before to get the nation's deficit under control – and grow our economy – and we will do it again.\nOver these past months, nothing made a greater impact on me than the stories I heard from so many families around the country about health care in America. Businesses and individuals are getting clobbered. The health care policies of our present leadership have not worked, are not working, and will not work. I intend to complete the mission begun by Harry Truman in 1948 and finally make health care available and affordable for all. None of us should ever have to hear again from a parent who fears that endlessly increasing costs will deny essential care for their children. We cannot stand by while hard-working people watch health insurance premiums rise out of reach. So we will finally get health care costs under control. And we must and will end the injustice of drug companies making bigger and bigger profits while more and more people go without insurance or the prescription medicine they need. The time has come for America to stop being the industrial country not to understand that health care is a right, and not a privilege.\nWe also have to meet the great challenges of freeing America from its dependence on oil from half a world away. As President, Jimmy Carter saw the nation's need, but we have waited almost 30 years – and we can no longer afford to wait. We reject the false choice of our opponents between energy and the environment. Our values lead us to safeguard our air and our water. And our vision leads us to a bold new plan for energy independence. The answer to soaring gas prices is not to drill in the Alaska Wilderness; it is to invest in the technologies of the future and create 500,000 new jobs in the process. And then future generations will never have to pay the price of war for Mideast oil.\nAnd whatever our disagreements on any specific issue, as we begin this general election, there is one message I want all Americans to hear – and which all of America's friends and enemies need to know: When it comes to defending our security and defeating the terrorist threat, this nation is united. We will stand as one country to protect the safety of our people. And we will never rest until we win the War on Terror.\nAnd as Commander-in-Chief, I will be ready to wage a more effective War on Terror – and we will win. By giving our troops the weapons and equipment they need, by rebuilding our alliances, and by giving our firefighters and first defenders the tools they rely on. Let's not forget it was the Democratic Party's leadership that helped build the military that performed so brilliantly in Afghanistan and Iraq – and we won't take a backseat to anyone when it comes to making America safe.\nAt times, conflict will come and the decision must be made. For a President, that decision may be lonely, but that does not mean that America should go it alone. We will fight for an America that is once again both respected for its might and admired for its ideals.\nAbove all, this country deserves leadership that faces the truth and tells the truth – that trusts the American people and knows that when we live up to our values, the United States of America never goes to war because it wants to, but only because it has to.\nAnd we will make it clear that the first definition of patriotism is keeping faith with those who wore the uniform of the United States of America.\nFor more than 35 years, I have fought for our country. And that is exactly what I intend to do as President. In this campaign, I have been reminded of something I learned as a young man on a Navy boat on the other side of the world: that what holds us together as Americans is so much more powerful than what divides us.\nGeorge Bush, who promised to be a uniter, has become the great divider. He has proposed to amend the Constitution for political purposes. He has no right to misuse the most precious document in our history in an effort to divide this nation and distract us from his failures.\nOur opponents can't campaign on jobs – or health care – or education – or fiscal responsibility. But we can – and we will.\nEverywhere I have been in America, I have seen the yearning for a new direction for our country. I've heard it in town meetings. I've seen it in the eyes of a middle aged couple where a husband lost his job – and his wife, who has breast cancer, has to keep working through her chemotherapy just to keep her health insurance. I have listened to families ask why they had to pay for body armor for sons and daughters on the frontlines in Iraq.\nI promise to be a President who fights for them – and for all our people.\nTogether, in the months ahead, we will call on the best in Americans – and stand up for the best America. We will give America back its future and its truth.\nNow let's go out there and win this election.\nI say to you tonight: A new day is on the way.", "timestamp": "2004-03-25", "title": "\"United for a New America\": Remarks of John Kerry"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29676", "text": "Before I begin, I couldn't be in this place, on this day, without saying a few words about the passing of a five foot giant named Mille Jeffrey. Her contribution to this school and this state and this country does not need to be recounted. But I think those of us who had the honor to know her – and indeed all Americans who believe in justice and equality for all our people – owe her a huge debt of gratitude. I'll say on a personal note that she showed how riding a Harley is really done. Millie once said, \"I didn't want to help people adjust to an unjust world. I wanted to change the world.\" Millie Jeffrey did just that – and we will miss her.\nThis election is about a new direction for our country – and a new direction for our economy –where we restore fiscal responsibility, help our workers become competitive, and bring back jobs. In this campaign, I have traveled this nation talking to people who are the backbone of our economy – from computer programmers to auto workers, from nurses to firefighters and police officers, from teachers to small business owners.\nOver and over again, I have been reminded of the optimistic, patriotic and entrepreneurial spirit of Americans who passionately believe in the best hopes of America. Yet, talking to them I have also seen a sense of injustice that needs to be reversed. Under this President, more and more of our people have begun to lose confidence that our economy is moving in the right direction. Americans, who in the 1990s never felt more confident, now wonder whether our economy will ever again provide good, middle-class jobs. Whether our leaders are more concerned with special interests and the most fortunate than with ensuring that our trading partners play by the rules or that we have the education and technology we need to compete and win the future. Too many of the people I have spoken with in town meetings, coffee shops and malls across this nation have lost confidence that we have a President who wakes up every morning ready to fight for their jobs, their families and our economic future. With your help, that's the President I intend to be.\nThe Americans I've met – no matter where they come or what their walk of life – live by a basic set of values. They work hard, pay their bills, and try to do what's right for their children and their communities. But this Administration hasn't honored those values – and it certainly hasn't lived by them.\nInstead of giving us an economy that creates jobs and opportunity, our present leadership has given us wedge issues designed to divide Americans. Instead of a real economic plan, they have given us the old politics of negative attacks.\nThis President doesn't have a record to run on, but a record to run from. A record of negative job growth and stagnant incomes, with long-term unemployment at its highest level in twenty years and manufacturing jobs at a fifty year low. Under President Bush, three million more Americans have slipped into poverty and four million more have lost their health insurance. Families struggle to pay the biggest increase in college tuition in history. Bankruptcies and foreclosures are the highest they have ever been. We've gone from record surpluses to record deficits. America cannot afford a President who's the first to lose jobs since Herbert Hoover in the Great Depression.\nWhen Franklin Roosevelt sought the Presidency, he pledged \"bold, persistent experimentation.\" \"Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try something else, but above all, try something.\" But President Bush took a method and tried it. It failed. But he stubbornly refuses to admit it, and his only answer to failure is more of the same.\nHe tried tax giveaways for the wealthy and the budget went into deficit and the country lost jobs. So he tried it again, and the budget went deeper into deficit and the country lost more jobs. He tried it a third time, and the country went into record deficit – and all those wasted billions still haven't brought back the jobs America's lost over the last three years. Now his major jobs proposal is tax cuts that won't even take effect until seven years from now.\nYou know, economic plans aren't just about dollars and decimals. They're about choices. Time after time, this Administration has put ideology first and jobs last. Today, I'm announcing a new economic plan for America that will put jobs first. We will renew American competitiveness, make tough budget choices, and invest in our future. My pledge – and my plan – is for 10 million new jobs in the next four years.\nThis is a realistic plan. I won't tell you that we can bring back every lost industry or protect every current job. But my plan will enable our economy to create jobs and keep more good jobs here in America. It offers a long-term strategy to win our economic future. We won't do it through government make-work, but by making our economy work so that businesses put Americans back to work.\nI will set out the details of this economic plan in the weeks ahead. I'll focus on raising American competitiveness:\n-- Spurring the growth of new industries like the broadband technology that will dominate the future.\n-- Lowering health care costs that put American businesses at a competitive and price disadvantage.\n-- Making sure our children have the education and our workers have the training and skills they need.\n-- And lowering energy costs which burden businesses and consumers and creating half a million new jobs in renewable fuels to make America energy independent of Mideast oil in ten years.\nI will outline specific steps to restore economic confidence and fiscal discipline by cutting the budget deficit in half in four years – making the federal government smaller but smarter, more effective and less expensive.\nSo I'm not running just to oppose present failures, but to propose new policies. This Spring, in a series of speeches, I will tell the American people, in specific terms, how we can enable our economy to create those 10 million new jobs. Today, I begin with a proposal for major tax reforms to help our workers compete in the global marketplace.\nOur Jobs First economic plan will end laws that encourage companies to export jobs while plowing back every dollar we save into new incentives to help companies create and keep jobs in America.\nWe now have a tax code that does more to reward companies for moving overseas than it does to reward them for creating jobs here in America. So if I am elected President, I will fight for the most sweeping international tax law reform in forty years – a plan to replace tax incentives to take jobs offshore with new incentives for job creation on our own shores.\nLet me explain.\nToday in America if a company is trying to choose between locating a factory in Michigan or Malaysia, our tax code has a feature called \"deferral\" that provides major tax savings if they locate abroad. So companies are driven to take advantage of legal tax incentives that have been on the books for too long and do not serve the economic interests of our nation.\nA company with $10 million in profits in Michigan will pay taxes at the standard corporate tax rate; but if that company moves to Malaysia and makes that same $10 million in profits, they can avoid paying US taxes – perhaps forever – as long as they keep the money overseas. They have a special tax incentive to send jobs overseas that may have little or nothing to do with normal market or economic forces.\nThe reform I'm proposing today is based on a simple principle: Money made by American businesses overseas should be taxed at the same rate as money made by businesses here at home. This won't affect American companies that locate production or serves in a foreign country to sell to consumers in that country. But it will apply to those who use those foreign locations to export products back to the United States or to other nations. If a company is torn between creating jobs here or overseas, we now have a tax code that tells you to go overseas. That's crazy. And if I am President, it will end.\nThe fact is that, taken together, the companies take advantage of the current tax laws don't pay a dollar in taxes. We actually end up paying them $8 billion a year to send their money and ship our jobs overseas. My proposal offers American companies a reasonable transition to adapt to this sweeping change. I don't want to punish anyone. But I believe it is long past time that we put our jobs first and put tax benefits that discourage jobs in America out of business.\nAnd I also propose to use the money we save from ending this tax giveaway for outsourcing to finance smart tax cuts that will create jobs here in America.\nLast August, I proposed a new jobs credit that would give manufacturers a break on the payroll taxes for every new worker they hire. I believe we should expand it to industries outside manufacturing where jobs are endangered by outsourcing – so that we help create more jobs, whether it comes to cars or computer software or call centers.\nSecond, the savings from ending the tax incentives for outsourcing can also expand jobs tax credit to cover all small businesses and their employees. For most small business owners, that means that if they create jobs, they will pay lower taxes in a Kerry Administration than they do under President Bush.\nThird, savings can finance a 25% tax credit for small businesses when they provide health care for their workers. The rise in health care costs under this Administration has hit everyone hard, but no one harder than small business owners and their employees. As the Chair of the Small Business committee in the Senate, I saw again and again how small businesses can be the engine of job creation – and those jobs are the ones most likely to be created here and to stay here.\nFourth, if we are willing to close loopholes and abuses in our tax system, then we can afford to lower taxes in the right way to spur growth and jobs. With the savings I proposed today, we can and should reduce the corporate tax rates by 5% – to improve competitiveness and to narrow the difference between corporate tax rates here and overseas. Some may be surprised to hear a Democrat calling for lower corporate tax rates. The fact is, I don't care about the old debates. I care about getting the job done and about creating jobs in America.\nFinally, I won't let America wage the fight for our economic future with one hand tied behind our back. No one should misunderstand me: I am not protectionist – but I am a competitor. American workers are the most competitive in the world – and they deserve a government that's as competitive as they are. We will demand our trading partners play by the rules they've agreed to and show them that America means business when it comes to enforcing our trade agreements. The Bush Administration has refused to enforce our trade agreements. That not only costs jobs; over time, it threatens to erode support for open markets and a growing global economy. And it deprives us of one of the most important tools we have to safeguard our own workers and our environment – and to raise standards internationally.\nAs President, I'll hold countries like China accountable when they manipulate their currency to inflate their exports and depress ours. Four years ago, in the Senate, we fought for and won a provision to prevent Chinese companies from flooding the American market and destroying American jobs. Three times a bipartisan, independent commission recommended to President Bush that he use this power to aid American workers. And three times, this President has said \"no.\" Just a few months ago, the Administration said they opposed efforts to increase the funds for enforcing trade agreements with China. They said the money just was \"unnecessary.\" I'll tell you what is necessary – a President who understands that open trade is essential for our prosperity, but unfair trade practices can undermine it.\nIt is time to insist on and enforce real worker and environmental provisions in the core of every trade agreement so that we don't exploit workers in other countries or sell them out here at home. And it's time to break the deadlock in Congress and pass real tax breaks for our manufacturing industries.\nFor the vast majority of companies in America – 99 percent – our Jobs First plan will cut their taxes and help them create new jobs. Some companies – that benefit from tax loopholes – will fiercely defend the status quo. I know how tough their lobbying will be. But I believe that's why we have elections in America – so that the people can set us on a new course. And I don't believe the course they want is to subsidize the loss of their own jobs. I have fought for my country for 35 years – and I am ready for this fight. With tax reform and tax cuts, with real fiscal responsibility, with new investments in the industries of the future, we can and will create 10 million new jobs for America – and lead our economy in a new direction. Together, let's give America back its prosperity and its future.", "timestamp": "2004-03-26", "title": "\"A Jobs-First Economic Plan\": Remarks of John Kerry"}

We see that there is so much work to be done in America.\nWe see jobs to be created.\nWe see families to house.\nWe see violence to stop.\nWe see children to teach – and children to care for.\nWe see too many people hungry in a country where food is abundant—and too many working families living in shelters, when a living wage should provide them with a place to live.\nThe scriptures say: \"It is not enough, my brother, to say you have faith, when there are no deeds.\"\nWe look at what is happening in America today and we say: \"Where are the deeds?\"\nWe are now told by some to ignore our greatest needs – to forget about the pain around us. We are told that, after 3 million lost jobs and so many lost hopes, America is now \"turning a corner.\"\nBut those who say America has turned the corner aren't standing on the corner of Highland Street, where two 15-year old teenagers were hit in a drive-by shooting last week.\nThey're not standing on the corner of North 19th Street, where the only place single mothers have to leave their children when they go to work is at the homeless shelter.\nAnd those who say that \"our economy is getting stronger and stronger\" aren't standing on the corners across this state where closed factories speak the loss of 42,000 manufacturing jobs in Missouri in the past 3 years.\nMy brothers and sisters, our present national leadership may be taking us around a corner, but it is a corner that leads to a dead end road paved with broken promises.\nWell, I'm here to say that if we stand together we can set a new direction for America.\nA new direction of hope and opportunity for all our children.\nIt's time to reach for that future. It's time to hear and heed the ancient proverb that should guide us today: \"When you pray, move your feet.\"\nIt was just 50 years ago that a little girl called Linda Brown had to walk a mile through a railroad yard everyday just to catch a bus to her segregated elementary school.\nHer parents, Darlene and Oliver Brown, saw the closed doors of the white elementary school just 3 blocks from their house-- and they turned their daughter and their nation in a new direction. They \"prayed by moving their feet.\"\nBecause of them America took a giant step forward, but there are still miles to go. In too many ways our school systems are still separate and unequal. Our society still falls short of our ideals. We still have doors to open, prayers to say, and feet to move.\nMy friends, we are called to restore a government of the people instead of a tool of the privileged. To honor hard work and the dream of a better life. To give every child the best possible start in life. To bring back good jobs and give new life to the pledge of liberty and justice for all. To end the moral outrage of an America which is the only industrialized nation on the planet which doesn't understand that healthcare is a right and not a privilege. We are called to end the worry of all the mothers and fathers who fear that their children may become casualties of unsafe streets.\nThe scriptures tell us that there is \"a time to break down and a time to build up.\"\nThis is our time to break down division, not build it up. It's time to reject the politics of falseness and fear calculated to divide black from white, rich from poor, neighborhood from neighborhood, region from region.\nI know, we all know, why some want to widen those divisions, not heal them. They want us, as a people, pointing fingers at each other so no one shines the light of truth on their own failed ways.\nThis is our time to start building up America again. Time to build up the material things that matter-- from our schools to health centers to depressed communities that can thrive again. But even more, time to build up the things of the spirit that lift us up—the sense that no matter where we come from, what we have or what we lack-- we are all God's children, linked together by the dignity of each and the shared destiny of all.\nSo let us pray. Let us move our feet. Let us march together and let us lead America in a new direction—toward that mountain top which has always been our destination. We won't get there in one year or one election. But this year is our time to take another giant step toward the country we can and should become.", "timestamp": "2004-03-28", "title": "Remarks to the New Northside Baptist Church in St. Louis, Missouri"}

As you may know, I'm about to go in for some minor surgery on my right shoulder. Always seems like I'm having some problems with the right wing these days.\nWe know that we have a long fight ahead of us – and we know that for working Americans everywhere, the stakes in this election have never been higher.\nSince George Bush took office, three million Americans have lost their jobs. Long-term unemployment is at its highest level in twenty years and manufacturing jobs are at a fifty year low. Four million more have lost their health insurance, and the middle-class's share of the tax burden has gone up while wages have gone down. This President has tried to cut overtime pay for millions of working Americans. And today, the one millionth American has lost their unemployment benefits because this President refused to extend them one day longer.\nWorking Americans deserve better. You deserve the ability to get ahead in return for hard work. You deserve a President who will stand up for the right to organize. You deserve a Secretary of Labor from the House of Labor. And most importantly, you deserve a President who puts jobs first. That's why last week I laid out my plan to create 10 million jobs in four years. We'll do it by ending the incentives for companies to ship jobs overseas, and by creating new incentives for businesses to create good jobs right here at home.\nWe look around this country and we see that there is so much work to be done in America.\nAnd America looks to you to do what you've done for a century – to build tomorrow's America – to build a future we can be proud of.\nThat means providing the funding necessary to address America's infrastructure deficit -- new schools, new hospitals, new roads and bridges for the 21st century.\nThat means protecting the prevailing wage. It means strengthening – not weakening – the Apprentice Training programs that teach young Americans a skill for life. America isn't hurting because we need more cheap labor, we're hurting because we need more highly skilled construction workers who can build the great projects of the future. And we have to train them and give them the opportunity to succeed.\nAnd that means including worker protections in construction bills before Congress. The Republicans have held up these bills before because they don't want these protections in there. Well we're not going to let them fool the American people. They're not trimming the fat. They're cutting Davis-Bacon and we're not going to let them.\nAs your President has said, \"the building trades put the movement in the labor movement.\" You are moving America forward by protecting workers, by promoting justice, by raising up schools, hospitals, and homes. You build the American Dream with your bare hands.\nWe've had four years to see who George Bush fights for. And we're here to say to working people: in November, it's going to be your turn. Your turn to have a President who hears your voices. Your turn to have a government on your side. A President fighting for you.\nThank you for standing with me in this fight. I am proud to stand with you. Every day, in this campaign and everyday if I am President, I will fight for the working men and women who are the strength and soul of America.\nI know the fight for jobs, the fight for affordable health care, the fight for trade policies that work for America won't be easy. But I've been in tough fights before. For 35 years, I've fought for my country and for people. And I'm ready to lead the battle for our jobs and our economic future.\nI say to all of you and all of America: get ready – a new day is on the way.", "timestamp": "2004-03-31", "title": "Remarks to the Building Trades Legislative Conference"}

I'd like to honor the memory of the brave soldiers who we've lost in this war.\nAnd I'd like to recognize the King family and thank them for being here with us. Ron and Pat King know what sacrifice is – today, their son Ronnie is serving his second tour in Iraq with the 7th Marine Regiment. Ron and Pat, we join you in praying for Ronnie's safe return and we thank him for his service to America.\nMy friends, we look around this country today and we see that there is so much work to be done in America.\nWe have jobs to create. We have an economy to grow. We have families to insure, children to teach, and communities to protect. And we have a War on Terror to win.\nBut after seeing 170,000 manufacturing jobs in Ohio disappear under this President –– after seeing hardworking families struggle with the costs of health care and tuition and taxes – after seeing communities go without cops and soldiers go without body armor, I think it's clear that the one person in America who deserves to be laid off is George W. Bush.\nIt's time for a new direction in America. Every economic plan that George Bush has proposed, this Republican Congress has passed. They promised us results – and now all they have to offer is excuses. Because the fact is that every time, at every turn, every chance he's had, George Bush has put jobs last.\nThis President's Commerce Department hosted workshops to show American companies how to outsource our jobs to China. That's putting jobs last.\nThis President's chief economic advisor said that outsourcing is a \"good thing.\" That's putting jobs last.\nAnd just last week – right here in Cincinnati – this President's Treasury Secretary told you that outsourcing makes our economy \"stronger.\" My friends, if that's their definition of strength, then that's putting jobs dead last.\nCincinnati, don't you think it's time for a change?\nDon't you think it's time for a President who knows what you're facing and is ready to do something about it?\nIsn't it time we put jobs first?\nUnder George Bush's watch we've lost 3 million jobs. That's why I've announced a plan to create 10 million jobs in the next four years – and that includes 417,000 new jobs right here in Ohio.\n10 million jobs for families who are trying to make ends meet.\n10 million jobs for Americans who are looking for work but can't find it.\n10 million jobs for the businesses who want to do the right thing and create jobs here at home.\n10 million jobs to make America the economic powerhouse that we all know we can be again.\nWe can do it – if we put jobs first.\nBy changing the tax code, so that it doesn't encourage companies to create jobs in Malaysia instead of Michigan, we're gonna put jobs first.\nBy giving companies a tax break to create and keep good jobs here at home, we're gonna put jobs first.\nBy making sure Washington pays its bills just like you have to pay yours, we're gonna put jobs first.\nBy making sure our trading partners play by the rules instead of playing us for fools, we're gonna put jobs first.\nEvery time, at every turn, every chance we get – we're gonna put jobs first. 10 million jobs first.\nIt's time to bring back an economy that creates good jobs. It's time to raise income levels across the board. It's time to give hardworking middle-class Americans a tax cut, not a tax increase. And it's time to put opportunity and prosperity in the hands of every American.\nIt's time for a new direction in America – and I'm ready to lead us there.\nI know the fight for jobs, the fight for affordable health care, the fight for trade policies that work for America won't be easy.

{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29680", "text": "Before we begin today, I want to honor the sacrifice made by the brave American soldiers who gave their lives in Iraq over these last difficult days. Our prayers and our thoughts are with their families, and we will never forget their service for the country we love.\nNo matter our disagreements over how to approach policy in Iraq, we are all united as a nation in supporting our troops and ultimately in our goal of a stable Iraq.\nWhen William Gaston, after whom this hall is named and this college's first student, arrived here in 1791, America was a young nation with a people yearning for freedom and opportunity. The promise of America was that the paths to a better life would be open to those who worked hard and planned for the future.\nThat is still the promise of the America we believe in and the America we must reclaim. And building an America in which middle class incomes are rising, good jobs are being created, and working people can build a better life for their families is what this election is all about.\nThere is a fundamental difference in this election: President Bush has no real economic plan for long term prosperity and higher standards of living. I do - and at its heart is a strategy to create 10 million new jobs in the first term of a Kerry Administration.\nThis President, whose tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans have left America 7 million jobs behind what he promised, now seems to think that one month when unemployment actually increased can make up for three years of massive job losses. He doesn't seem to know - or acknowledge - that the industries that are expanding pay an average of $9,000 less than ones that are contracting.\nGeorge Bush talks about a recovery, but doesn't seem to realize that today we have a wage recession in America - with average Americans workers making $1,200 less a year; with millions of families struggling to pay higher health care costs, higher property taxes, and higher college tuitions - all of it out of lower incomes. While Americans are becoming more and more productive, they are increasingly working at lower wage jobs.\nPresident Bush praises the productivity of our workers, but never mentions the unfairness which denies them the gains of their own labor.\nDue to George Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, the average worker now pays more in taxes at the local level. The burden for most Americans has gone up while wages have gone down.\nBy almost every measure of real life in the real America, George W. Bush just doesn't seem to understand what's happening to hard-working families.\nSo the great issue in this election is how to move America in a new direction.\nAnd a strong America begins at home - with the state of our economy.\nBut instead of a credible economic plan and an honest debate, our present leadership has given us the old politics of false and simplistic negative attacks. I am committed to a different course.\nTwo weeks ago, in the first of a series of speeches, I set out my proposal to end tax benefits that encourage outsourcing and actually reward American companies for moving jobs overseas. Outsourcing will occur, but a company that stays here should not be put at a competitive disadvantage because a company that leaves can defer paying its taxes - perhaps forever. That's the law today; in fact, our taxpayers even spend $12 billion a year to subsidize the export of jobs. If I am President, I will fight to change that law - first, as a matter of simple equity: American workers should not be paying for the destruction of their own livelihoods.\nSecond, I will invest the savings from reform in new incentives to create new, good paying jobs here - and to lower corporate taxes by 5% to make all our companies more competitive. Let me be clear: under my plan, 99 percent of American businesses and 98 percent of Americans will get a tax cut.\nIn coming weeks, I will focus on the health care costs that today burden American enterprise and - for example - make it $1700 more expensive to produce the same car here than it costs in Canada. And I will discuss how America, by investing in new technology, in broadband, and in the great imperative of energy independence can lead the world in the jobs of the future.\nToday, I turn to an issue that is essential to all the others because it is the foundation of confidence in our economic future. In the last three years, the federal budget has gone from record surpluses to record deficits - which, if left unchecked, can become a fiscal cancer that will erode any recovery and threaten the prospect of a lasting prosperity. Ultimately, as deficits drive up long term interest rates, they will dry up investment and undermine the belief, at home and overseas, that America is worth investing in.\nGeorge Bush now promises to reduce the deficit - the same promise of fiscal responsibility he has made and broken in every year, every budget, and every State of the Union message. The record is clear: a deficit reduction promise from George W. Bush is not exactly a gilt edged bond; and if he continued in the Presidency and performed as he has in the past, a third Bush term could mean a third Bush recession.\nWhen it comes to the federal budget, I will move America in a new direction - by cutting the deficit in half in four years while making health care affordable; by paying for every program I propose; and by rolling back the Bush tax cut for the wealthiest Americans while expanding tax cuts for the middle class.\nThis will not be easy. It will require tough decisions - not just for one budget or one campaign, but for years to come and often in the face of unforeseen circumstances. But I know we can take this course and stay this course - because we've done it before.\nAnd that is why Americans can trust what I am saying: I have a voting record that, on the most critical budget votes of the last 20 years, helped balance our budget and pay down our debt.\nWhen I first came to the Senate in 1985, the federal deficit was soaring- as it is today.\nIn the 1980's, the national debt clock in New York City became a symbol for a federal deficit and debt that were out-of-control. Back then, many Democrats thought we could spend and spend without having to pay the bill. And back then, most Republicans even claimed that if you gave huge tax cuts to the wealthy, they would somehow pay for themselves. I guess that's what they mean by \"an elephant never forgets.\"\nAt that the time, I joined together with a group of reformers from both parties - like Republican Senator Warren Rudman and Democratic Senator Fritz Hollings - to push for a deficit reduction plan with real teeth. What we got was real grief from leaders in both parties - and by the early 90s, the deficit was increasing so fast that the debt clock would sometimes breakdown because it couldn't keep up.\nWe made tough choices in 1993 - when a new President challenged the Congress to return to fiscal sanity. And the choice really was tough; fiscal sanity won by exactly one vote. I was proud to cast a deciding vote in the Senate to bring the deficit under control. In 1997, we finished the job by passing an historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement - which not only balanced the budget for the first time since 1969, but extended the life of Medicare, expanded health care for children, and cut taxes for middle class Americans.\nBy 2000, we were on the road to saving Social Security and we were paying down our national debt for the first time since Andrew Jackson was president - 170 years ago. The numbers on the national debt clock were spinning backwards.\nJust before George Bush took office, the clock was taken down. Talk about wishful thinking.\nThe new President, who had promised to change the partisan tone in Washington, promptly turned his back on the bipartisan balanced budget consensus of the 1990s. Instead of short term decisions to stimulate the economy, he made long term mistakes that exploded the deficit.\nHe lavished tax cuts we couldn't afford on those who didn't need them. He made a clear choice: to pass the bucks to the privileged while passing the buck to our children. Because of this President's decisions, a child born today will inherit at $20,000 debt - a \"Birth Tax\" that he or she had no part in creating.\nIn New York, the national debt clock has been turned back on - with the numbers rising faster than the human eye can see.\nIn a blink of history's eye, trillions in budget surpluses have been transformed into trillions in deficits over the next decade. From missions to Mars to tax cuts for the wealthy to a Medicare bill that benefits drug companies and burdens seniors, the Bush Administration has failed to pay for what it has proposed. This President has proposed or passed $6 trillion in initiatives in the next ten years alone that he has no plan to pay for.\nHis record shows that we can't trust what he says. And no matter what he says now, the Bush policies will not reduce the deficit but worsen it.\nInstead of facing that reality, George Bush stubbornly refuses to change course. When false promises don't work, he tries excuses. Blaming everyone from Bill Clinton to Ken Lay to Saddam Hussein.\nBut that is not the reason for our own budget crisis. The independent, non-partisan Congressional Budget Office reported last month that 94 percent of the $500 billion deficit for next year is due to George Bush's excessive spending and ineffective tax giveaways for the wealthiest Americans. In fact, his tax cuts alone account for most of the long-term deficit increase.\nAnd the price is being paid in many ways.\nThis Administration has squandered the historic opportunity to use the surpluses to save Social Security. Job creation is slowed by increased uncertainty about our economic future. And we are weakened abroad as well as at home. With our national debt increasingly owned by foreign governments, we devalue our own bargaining power with countries like China when they manipulate their currency to inflate their exports, depress ours, and in effect destroy American jobs.\nSo the deficit is not just about the numbers and statistics - although they are a damning indictment of the Bush record. The issue of fiscal responsibility will shape our entire economic future. My pledge is to restore fiscal discipline - and my budget plan is built on three economic principles.\nFirst, we will not raise taxes on middle class Americans; we will lower them.\nThe Bush Administration has engineered the greatest tax shift in American history. Middle class Americans are now paying more of the national budget; wealthy Americans are paying less. Our present national leadership has transferred the tax burden from wealth to work. We will restore tax fairness. We will expand middle class tax cuts for families with children and married couples and pass new tax cuts to make education and health care more affordable while cutting our deficit in half.\nBut for Americans making more than $200,000, we will simply roll back the Bush tax rates to the level they were under Bill Clinton to pay for education and health care. With these resources, we can expand health care for all of our children and cover virtually all Americans while lowering the health care premiums that are squeezing families and hurting job creation.\nI realize that honorable people can disagree about whether it makes sense to repeal the recent tax cuts for Americans making more than $200,000 so we can afford to invest in health care and education. I am willing to debate that disagreement at any time or place. It is a fundamental choice about our future and a central choice in this election.\nBut rather than debating real differences, the Bush campaign is engaged in the politics of deceit and distortion.\nThey are spending millions of dollars trying to mislead Americans about the basic facts: If you make less than $200,000, you'll get a tax cut under my plan. If you make more than $200,000 a year, you will go back to paying the same tax rates you did with President Clinton and our country will get health care and education. The top 2% will pay more than they do now. Everyone else will get a tax cut under a Kerry Administration.\nLet me repeat: 98% of individuals - and 99% of companies and small businesses - will pay lower taxes under my plan.\nSecond, we will impose spending restraints so no one can propose or pass a new program without a way to pay for it. And we'll enforce budget discipline with spending caps. During the 1990s, we had spending caps. We cut the deficit in half and then balanced the budget. And along the way, we created 23 million new jobs, increased family income across the board, and gave middle class families a tax cut. Because we limited the growth of government's budget, family budgets were able to grow.\nSo my budget plan pays for my proposals. In contrast to George Bush's $6 trillion in unpaid-for spending, my plan returns to a concept known as 'pay-as-you-go.'\nAnd in the months ahead, as I put forward new ideas for a stronger, better, more prosperous America, I will state, in specific terms, how to finance them without raising the deficit or middle class taxes.\nI have already shown how we can pay for my health care plan and education. But we can and will do more by reducing or eliminating government programs that don't work.\nFor example, we'll freeze the federal travel budget, reduce oil royalty exemptions for drilling on federal lands, and cut 100,000 contractors now employed by the federal government. We'll streamline government agencies and commissions and reduce out-of-control administrative costs by five percent. And when we're done, the federal government will be smaller but smarter, more effective and less expensive.\nThe strong spending caps in my plan will insure that spending doesn't grow faster than inflation. If Congress fails to keep spending in line, the budget caps will mean across the board cuts in every area except security and education and mandatory spending programs like health care, Social Security and Medicare.\nSo when I say a cap on spending, I mean it. We will have to make real choices - and that includes priorities of my own.\nLet me give you a couple of examples. I've proposed a major expansion of national service programs to strengthen the values of patriotism, community and citizenship. And I believe we need to make pre-school universal so that every child in America gets the best possible start in life. But with the deficit worsening each and every day of the Bush Administration, we may have to slow both initiatives down or phase them in over a longer period. I don't like that. But those are the hard calls a President has to make.\nThird, we will free resources and reduce the deficit by taking on corporate welfare. John McCain and I have introduced legislation to end corporate welfare as we know it. In a Kerry Administration, we will fight for that bill; we will take our case to the public if we have to - and we will pass it. Today, mining companies buy up public lands for five dollars an acre.\nAnd Dick Cheney's old company Halliburton dodges taxes with offshore havens while it gets billions from no-bid government contracts. If I'm elected President, those days will come to an end.\nBy going after corporate welfare, as John McCain says, we can save tens of billions of dollars a year. Our bill calls for a Corporate Subsidy Reform Commission to recommend cuts and submit them to Congress for an up or down vote - with no amendments.\nJohn McCain can't get anyone in the Bush White House to listen to our proposal. If I'm President, John McCain will get the first pen when I sign this bill into law.\nWe can't restore fiscal responsibility unless we have a President willing to bring our divided parties together - and ready to be straight with the public about what we can and can't afford.\nWe can cut the deficit in half in four years, expand health care coverage, and make it more affordable for the families who already have it. We can invest in education, restore pay as you go rules, and impose spending caps. We can rollback the Bush tax cuts for those at the top - and cut taxes for middle class Americans.\nWe can do all this if we set clear national priorities - and make the tough decisions - not just about the programs of others, but about our own proposals.\nAnd we have to do this - because it is critical to any credible economic plan and the creation of new, good-paying jobs. An America that ignores the deficit will be an America that invites inflation and recession.\nAn America that pays for new initiatives and follows real budget rules will be able to build a new era of prosperity.\nWe know how to do this. We did it in the 1990s. Now it's time to return our government to fiscal responsibility - and our country to investment in the future, to job creation and rising standards of living.\nAnd if I am President, that is the new direction I will set for our budget and our economy.\nNone of these choices are about numbers or dollars alone. They are the choices we make that build the fiber of our nation. They are the responsibility our generation has been handed and the legacy that we hand to the generations to come. This is the course we must choose. This is the course we will chart together.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2004-04-07", "title": "Remarks at Georgetown University in Washington, DC"}

Now I knew that Guster was going to be a tough act to follow, so I came prepared today with an offer you can't refuse:\nI am not the type to make empty promises. But, if you make me your next President, my first executive order will be to give a full pardon for anything you did on spring break. Sound good?\nIt's great to be back in New Hampshire. When I left this state two months ago, I was riding a wave of momentum that you all built from the ground up. And over the next seven months, I'm counting on New Hampshire to keep us riding that wave all the way to the White House.\nAnd it's great to be back at UNH. I actually had a big fight with my staff over what time to have this rally. They wanted noon. I said 3:30 – that way most of you would actually be awake.\nFifty-nine years ago today, America lost Franklin Roosevelt -- one of the greatest leaders we've ever had – a man who led the Greatest Generation through its darkest hours with the strength to make America believe that happy days were just around the corner.\nWhen he ran for President, Roosevelt promised America a New Deal, where everyone would \"shoulder our common load.\" This week, I'll be unveiling a Compact with the Next Generation – your generation – that says we're going to bring back the basic bargain at the heart of America: if you're willing to do right by America, than America's willing to do right by you. It says that every one of you is ready and willing to take on the challenges we face in 2004. So how 'bout it New Hampshire, are you ready?\nAre you ready to go out into your communities and serve the country you love?\nAre you ready to bring back a government that tells the truth to all of the people, all of the time?\nAre you ready to send George W. Bush on a bus back to Crawford, Texas?\nAre you ready to raise the drinking age to thirty? Good, just wanted to make sure you were still listening.\nHere's the truth. This election is not about me. And this election is not about President Bush. This election is about you. Because this is your future we're talking about here. And there has never been more at stake.\nIt's your tuition and your loans that keep rising and rising every day while this President spends all our money on tax cuts for the wealthy. That's his choice.\nIt's your generation that is being sent to Iraq to risk your lives in a war this President has no plan to win. That's his choice.\nIt's your environment that's being turned over to big polluters, your right to choose that hangs in the balance, and your deficit you'll be paying down for the rest of your lives. Those are all his choices.\nWell guess what? In November, it's gonna be your choice.\nYou know, I've heard George Bush has had some great one-liners on the campaign trail recently. This one especially cracks me up. He says, \"I came to this office to solve problems and not pass them on to future generations.\" Funny guy, huh?\nWe cannot and we will not pass America's problems on to your generation. But the fact is, this election is not just about what we're going to do, it's about what you're going to do. Because this November, change starts with you.\nOur Compact with the Next Generation is going to offer a lot to young people in this country. But like no President since John F. Kennedy, I'm also going to ask young people to give something back.\nI'm going to ask you to serve your country. This compact will bring the greatest expansion of national service in history and we're going to ask you to step up to the plate to do what's right for America – to go out into your communities and teach children, be mentors, build homes, and protect America.\nAnd here's what else our compact brings: With college tuition rising higher this year than ever before, it's time to make four years of college affordable and available to every single young American.\nWe'll help you pay for school, and we'll help even more if you're willing to serve your country. And together, we'll make 2004 the last year that debt and dollar signs come before degrees and dreams for the future.\nWhen you finish college, I want you to remember the duty you owe your country, not the debt you owe the bank.\nBut we can't do this without your help because change starts with you. It's your generation that can make it happen because it's your generation that always has.\nIt was a 26-year old minister from Montgomery named Martin Luther King Jr. who led a bus boycott to change the hearts of a divided nation.\nIn the 1960s, it was college students who told Lyndon Johnson he could not run for President again because he did not tell America the truth about why he was sending their friends to die in Vietnam.\nAnd on September 11, 2001, it was firefighters and paramedics not much older than you who were running up the stairs of the World Trade Center while everyone else was running down.\nToday, I am asking all of you to look at all the challenges we face in America and ask what you can do to get the job done. So that one day you can look back and say \"I was there in 2004 when we changed America.\"\nSo I ask you not just to vote, but to tell your friends, register your classmates, and change a few minds along the way. 10 million college kids can easily take the $100 million in Republican attack ads they've got running.\nSo when it comes to good jobs, change starts with you.\nWhen it comes to affordable tuition, change starts with you.\nWhen it comes to serving America to build a better America, change starts with you.\nWhen it comes to a safer foreign policy, a cleaner politics, and an America we can be proud of, change starts with you.\nAnd when we win, change will go through our neighborhoods and our schools and our hospitals and our communities and it will reach every corner of America.\nChange will start with you, and when we win, change will go all the way to the White House.\nDon't doubt you can change the world. Only doubt those who say you can't.\nYou can build a better America. You can bring back hope. You can shape your future. You can make history.\nAnd this year, that's exactly what we're gonna do. So let's go out there and get it done.", "timestamp": "2004-04-12", "title": "Remarks at the University of New Hampshire in Durham"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29682", "text": "Good morning, this is John Kerry and I would like to talk with you about the current very critical situation in Iraq. We all know that events there have taken a dramatic turn for the worse. Each day, it seems more American soldiers are killed. Civilians from half a dozen allied countries have been kidnapped. Too many of the Iraqi military and police, whom we trained, have refused to fight. Extremists appear to be gaining confidence and have vowed to drive our troops from the country.\nWe cannot – and will not – let that happen. Americans differ about whether and how we should have gone to war. But it would be unthinkable now for us to retreat in disarray and leave behind a society deep in strife and dominated by radicals. All Americans are united in backing our troops and meeting our commitment to help the people of Iraq build a country that is stable, peaceful, tolerant and free.\nBut staying the course does not mean stubbornly holding to the wrong course. In order to complete our mission, we must review our tactics.\nWe need strategies that reflect realistic goals and the facts on the ground. The President had a chance on Tuesday night to present such a strategy, but chose not to.\nIt is now more important than ever that we take a different approach, designed to maximize our chance for success by making full use of the assets we have.\nFirst, our leaders must level with the American people and be honest and upfront about the difficulties we face. The President may not want to admit to mistakes, but his choices in Iraq have so far produced a tragedy of errors.\nSecond, we must recognize that progress is not possible in Iraq if people lack the security to go about the business of daily life. We must supply our military commanders with the additional troops they have requested. But the military alone cannot win the peace in Iraq.\nThe use of force must be combined with a diplomatic strategy that will work. United Nations representatives have put forward a fair proposal for an interim government. It will allow Iraqis from all factions to participate. It's a good starting point, but it leaves many hard questions unanswered.\nThat is why, for the long term, our third step we must remove the \"Made in America\" label from the Iraqi occupation.\nWe can do that by creating an international mission authorized by the United Nations. That mission should become the main civilian partner in helping the Iraqi people hold elections, restore government services and rebuild their economy. This would make it possible to attract needed financial help from other nations, and show that Iraqi extremists are opposing not just the United States, but also the will of the nations of the world. Removing that \"Made in America\" label can send a message to Iraqi military and police that its time to do their jobs not because America is telling them to, but because the world stands ready to help them secure a stable Iraq.\nFourth, we should transform the military force in Iraq into a NATO security force under the leadership of an American commander. By sharing responsibilities with our friends and allies, we can get others to share the burdens and the risks. Given the dangers in Iraq it won't be easy to get our friends and allies to send in new troops, but I am confident that we can do that with real leadership and a commitment to share authority as well as responsibility. To achieve this we need a major diplomatic effort including a high level mission to consult with our NATO partners.\nBecause of the go-it-alone policy in Iraq, our troops have borne ninety percent of the risks and casualties, while our taxpayers have paid ninety percent of the costs. The failure of the Administration to internationalize the conflict has lost us time, momentum, and credibility – and made America less safe. Our stubborn, unilateral policy in Iraq has steadily drifted – from tragedy to tragedy. Our troops deserve better. To succeed in Iraq, we must be tough enough to stick to our principles in the face of setbacks. But we must also be smart enough to fight the enemy with all the tools and all the help we can find. Our troops today are paying the price for a flawed policy. We need a new policy that puts our soldiers first.\nThis is John Kerry.

{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29683", "text": "Thank you. I'm glad to be in Houston on Earth Day.\nI've been spending the last few days talking with Americans about how we can build a cleaner, healthier environment. And while there's plenty that we're going to do differently than this Administration on this issue, let me start by saying something nice about President Bush-he is an expert on recycling. He's recycled the same bad Republican policies from the 1980's all over again in the year 2004.\nThank you Dr. Lauren. Your story reminds all of us about a basic American idea: \"we can all make a difference and each one of us should try.\" When it comes to protecting our environment, strengthening our economy, and improving public health, effort is everything.\nWhether it's saving our great public spaces like this one, stopping polluters from sending toxins into the water your drink, or protecting those national treasures we count on for our jobs, our livelihoods, and to feed our souls, our responsibility as Americans is to protect and preserve God's gift to human kind.\nWe only have one chance with this place, and you and I together are going to make sure we use it wisely. We're going to ensure that our values and our beliefs reflect in how we treat our oceans, how we develop our small towns in the mountains, and how we protect our national parks and treasures.\nFor we are all stewards of our land and water. We are all capable of creating lasting change. And we are all determined to ensure that those Americans who have yet to grace this earth can live in a country that keeps them healthy and gives them the opportunity to reach their full potential.\nBut you and I know that we cannot succeed unless we change course. We cannot build a stronger America together—an America that protects our air and our water and our children—unless we change course in November.\nOne of the great traditions in America is an unspoken vow between the old and the young. For generations, older Americans have worked hard to ensure that the America they leave behind is smarter, stronger, and more secure than when they found it.\nYet, for the first time in our history, this tradition may end and an older generation may pass on an America that is in worse shape than when they found it. We're facing trillions of dollars in debt. Our foreign policy has pushed the world aside and left us to face threats on our own. We have a health care crisis that is emptying the pockets of working families. And in three short years, one man and one Administration has put the breaks on 30 years of environmental progress.\nHouston, do you want four more years of rolling back our clean air laws that pollute our air and give our kids asthma? Do you want four more years of arsenic in our drinking water? Do you want four more years of mercury levels rising in women and children? Do you want four more years of polluters getting a tax break while you're stuck with the bill? Do you want four more years of ignoring our allies to stop global warming? Neither do I! Their kind of environment is hazardous to our health, our kid's health, and the world's.\nWe can do better because we know that the environment is about something bigger than a photo-op event once a year. It's about protecting our economy, our public health, and our way of life. They are all connected and they are all endangered if we don't change course in November.\nSo Houston will you help me change course in November? Will you help me lead America to a place where no soldier ever has to be sent overseas because of our dependence on Mid-east oil? Will you help me protect our coastlines and preserve those towns we count on for jobs and to raise our families? Will you help me protect our clean air and clean water laws so that our kids grow up healthy?\nHouston will you help me make sure that next Earth Day George Bush celebrates it back home in Texas?\nThis week I have spent time in Florida and along the coast of Louisiana. I talked about the common sense steps we can take today that will protect those places we love while creating jobs and protecting our economy. This Administration uses the same tired old argument that you can't have a clean environment if you want a strong economy. Well they're wrong. We can have both.\nI have a plan that will make this country independent from Mid-East oil in ten years. And it will create 500,000 new jobs doing something that's right for our environment, right for our economy, and right to strengthen our national security. We will put that tired old Republican argument to rest when we elect a new president in November!\nI have a plan that will protect our oceans and our water ways. I will enforce the BEACHES ACT and provide states with funding so that we know our beachwater is clean. I will work with local officials like Houston's great Mayor Bill White to create strong partnerships to reduce storm-water runoff. I will provide our states and local communities with the resources they need to protect important coastal ecosystems and implement smart coastal development.\nAnd when it comes to mercury, I will not let the utilities off the hook. It just makes sense when 4.9 million women of childbearing age have high levels of mercury, and when one in six new born-infants have levels of mercury so high that they can cause brain damage. You stop the polluters to protect the health of women and children!\nYesterday, I talked about my plan to protect our coastlines. In Louisiana, every 30 minutes a piece of land the size of a football field sinks into the Gulf of Mexico. Costal erosion isn't just swallowing their beaches; it's drowning their economy. Fishermen see their nets come up empty. Sportsmen watch entire habitats disappear. And families who live and visit those coastline towns fear that their homes or businesses may literally slip away.\nWe can change this. We can enact laws that conserve and protect coastal regions here and all over America. We will make the protection of our coastlines a national priority, because a secure coastline means security for the families who live there, the business owners who make a living there, and the sportsmen who hunt and fish there.\nThis is what we can do when we change course in November. All it takes is a president who understands that there are no false choices to make between a clean environment and a strong economy—we can and we will have both when I am president.\nWe have great local leaders like Mayor Bill White, who are dedicated to making their cities and neighborhoods healthy places to live, work, and raise their families.\nMayor White has been a leader in advocating the use of new technologies to reduce the energy use in buildings. The use of tree planting, paving and roofing materials which reflect, not absorb heat. This could reduce energy bills and over time reduce outside air temperatures. We need to support innovative thinking like that.\nYou know when I was young I learned this invaluable lesson about our environment from my mother. She taught me how to recycle before it became second nature for so many Americans today. And often, she would wake me up in the middle of the night, take me outside and say, \"Listen.\"\n30 years ago, a generation listened to Rachel Carson and her wisdom. I was proud to be apart of that movement then—painted Storrow Drive in Boston a biodegradable green-- and throughout my time in the senate.\nWe saw our country transform from a place where lakes caught fire, there was lead in our gasoline, and polluters had free reign to send anything into our sky, our land, and our water ways. But we put an end to that and we are not going to let this Administration put an end to 30 years of progress.\nThirty-five years ago, when I was on a boat, drifting along Vietnam's Mekong Delta, I grew up with a band of brothers from all walks of life and every corner of America. We learned many things on that journey, but above all, we learned that we were never the kid from South Carolina, Iowa, Arkansas, California, or the kid from Massachusetts.\nUnder the heat of fire and the fog of battle, our mission became crystal clear, and color, religion, and background melted away. We understood that we were all simply \"Americans.\" All of us fighting under the same flag, praying to the same God.\nI'm running for President because I believe that we are all in the same boat, not all on our own. I believe that no matter what our differences, Americans all over this country want pretty much the same things in life. We want to be united, not divided. We want to believe there is more we can do about the problems facing America, not less. We want the opportunity to build a better life, not more barriers to prosperity.\nSo let's go out of here determined to keep that tradition begun by our forefathers of caring for this great land of ours and handing it on to our children in better shape then we were given it. Let's work our hearts to make sure that the America we pass on is a country with clean rivers, clean air, clean water, with a safer environment that once again sees the smoke from the smokestacks disappear right along with our kid's asthma.\nWith the right leadership again, we can be a nation that is once again filled with people who never forget that we are not the inheritors of the earth, but the stewards for the future. And when I am President, we will respect that deep rooted value in the United States of America, not just on Earth Day, but every day!", "timestamp": "2004-04-22", "title": "Remarks on Earth Day 2004 in Houston, Texas"}

I came to Washington with other Vietnam Veterans to protest the war. And for me, Mary wasn't just covering the story; she was part of the story. At the hearing, she was there. At the Mall, she was there. And in her 50's she walked with us across the Memorial Bridge to the locked gates at Arlington Cemetery.\nA story wasn't just a story to Mary-it was personal. Personal to her and to her readers. Because getting the story right, getting the truth told, and getting her readers involved was her service to her country.\nShe had a Pulitzer, a loyal following, a loving family and friends, and a spot on Nixon's enemies list. It doesn't get any better than that. Everything that your business can be, Mary was. Everything was on the record. Every source had a name. And every story was a success because she went out and she got it. We will miss her and we are so very grateful that she graced our lives.\nTwo hundred twenty-nine years ago, the first Patriots from Massachusetts put their lives on the line at Lexington Green. Nearby, Samuel Adams - who was not only a Patriot, but at times a newspaper editor - heard the battle shots of freedom and declared, \"What a glorious morning for America is this!\"\nFor once, an editor got it right. Today, with all the grim news we read each day in your newspapers, it is important to remember what a glorious morning it has been for America - and that glorious days lie ahead.\nI know that every four years people who are running for president tell you that this is the most important election. Well this one is different: It's the most important election in our lifetime. Today, we confront challenges as great as any in our history.\nIf you don't believe that this is the most important election in our lifetime, then all you have to do is look at your front pages. We see the haunting images of our soldiers loading flagged draped coffins. We see rows of them in the belly of a cargo plane for their long flight home. We see images of them being saluted on their final march to their final resting place. And those images are paired with a story about a husband and wife who took photos to show the world the touching way we honor our fallen. And they were fired for their openness and honesty. My friends truth is on the line in the election.\nIf you don't believe that this election is the most important in our life time, then all you have to do is look at the stories about the millions of middle class families who are struggling to get ahead. There are record bankruptcies, record foreclosure rates, and Americans owe more than $750 billion in credit card debt. And last year, because the cost of tuition has soared, 220,000 young people had to give up on their dream of a better future. These men and women built America. They worked hard. They contribute week after week And in return, they're told by this Administration, \"You're on your own.\" My friends fundamental fairness is at stake in this election.\nIf you don't believe that this election is the most important in our lifetime, then all you have to do is look at the story about Iraq. First, the Administration would have you believe that we are about to turn over authority in Iraq to a new government – a handover that will signal the end of America's occupation. But, in reality, we are no closer to a real Iraqi government able to provide security for its people, make laws and ensure freedoms. This is still America's problem. My friends the strength of our national security is stake in this election.\nThe American ideas of fundamental fairness, truth, and hope are what brought me to a life of service. And I am running for president because I want to bring those ideas back to the American people so that together, we can build a stronger America.\nTen years ago, the Republicans introduced what they called \"The Contract with America.\" They say that the contract was written to give the American people more faith and trust in their government. But it did the opposite.\nThis wasn't a \"Contract with America.\" It was a contract against our values and our way of life. Behind the slogans and rhetoric was an effort to balance the budget on the back of the most vulnerable Americans – drastic cuts in Medicare and Medicaid and the Earned Income Tax Credit to pay for a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans.\nThe Contract lead to the shut down of our nation's government as Democrats fought to keep open the Department of Education, to preserve our commitment to every child opportunity through good schools.\nSupporters of the Contract were willing to shut down the federal government in order to impose their extreme agenda on the nation, including dramatic cuts in clean water programs, child health and nutrition funding, and long term care for America's disabled and parents and grandparents. I was proud to stand up against those fights then, and I'm proud to continue those fights today.\nThe Contract didn't help our nation. It wasn't a \"Contract with America.\" It was a\nContract that divided America.\nAnd since that time, our politics has defined America down, instead of lifting Americans up with a sense of common purpose. The high road is harder, but it leads to a better place. That is why, in the months ahead, Republicans and Democrats must make this election a campaign of ideas, not attacks - not just point fingers at one another, but point America in a new direction.\nI'm even willing to grant that George Bush was right about a couple things in the 2000 campaign: We do need to change the tone in Washington, with leaders who are uniters, not dividers. We do need a responsibility era and a president who's a reformer with results. Those promises were worth making. And if I'm elected those promises will be kept.\nSo much of what I know about being an American I learned in Vietnam. I didn't have to go, but the tug of duty and country compelled me. The lessons our band of brothers learned have been with us ever since. On that tiny boat, we no longer came from different races, regions, or religions. We were Americans, together under the same flag, stronger for giving ourselves to a cause bigger than ourselves.\nThat sense of duty has been the defining moment not only of my life, but of my country's. For more than 200 years, that has been the great promise of America: Giving everyone the opportunity to achieve their God-given potential, and challenging them to make the most of it. For too long now, many in our political system have tried to walk away from that basic bargain. I intend to keep it.\nSo today, let me tell you why I am running for President. I believe we live in a dangerous world, with enemies known and unknown plotting and planning to do us harm. Osama Bin Laden has not been captured or killed, al Qaeda remains a threat as it transforms and changes, and Iraq remains unstable. Together, I know that with the right plan-one that works with the world-we will keep America safe.\nI believe that to be strong in the world, we must be strong at home, and that in Andrew Jackson's words, the promise of America is \"equal opportunity for all, special privileges for none.\" I believe the measure of America's economy is a growing middle class, and to achieve that we must expand the reach of opportunity, not the size of government.\nI believe in the values that form our common bond: hard work, fairness, and truth. Most of all, I believe that citizenship brings responsibilities as well as rights, and that all Americans have a duty to give something back.\nBut to succeed, a President must set clear priorities. And today, I am introducing my \"Contract with America's Middle Class.\"\nThe first responsibility of the President is to keep our country safe and secure. And I will. I'm running because we are in a new kind of war, and we need a commander in chief with a plan to fight this war and win it.\nAmericans have never failed the cause of human freedom, and we will not fail it now-not in Iraq, not in Afghanistan, not anywhere. I have many differences with President Bush over how we should wage the war against terrorism and extremism. I think he made a huge mistake in relying on local Afghan forces to capture Osama bin Laden, rather than committing sufficient U.S. forces on the ground to do the job.\nBut we share the same goal of total victory. You can count on this: No matter who wins this presidential election, the terrorists will lose.\nAs President, I will never hesitate to use American power to defend our interests anywhere in the world. I will stand up for our country, our flag, and our values, and make it clear that the first definition of patriotism is keeping faith with those who wore the uniform of our country.\nI will make America's armed forces even stronger by adding troops so our forces are spread to thin around the globe and by making sure our forces have the armor and support they need. But what this administration doesn't understand is that to win this war, we must make the world respect America's other sources of strength: our economic engine, our ideals, and our profound purpose to be the last, best hope of earth.\nThe second priority in my contract with the middle class is this: I will put the economy and government back in line with our values.\nThe middle class is the moral and economic backbone of this nation. Franklin Roosevelt realized that and he set in motion programs that helped people go to college, buy a house, and build their wealth. The country prospered: we created nearly 11 million new jobs and homeownership increased by 13 percent from 1950-1960.\nPresident Clinton saw the same thing. His plans invested in people and we created 23 million new jobs, 7 million Americans were lifted out of poverty, and more Americans went to college. The middle class built this country. They work hard, pay their bills, and do right by their families and their country. This country ought to do right by them.\nFor too long, this Administration hasn't honored those values, and it certainly hasn't lived up to them. They've put wealth ahead of work, something-for-nothing ahead of responsibility, and special privilege for the few ahead of what's right for the nation.\nMy plan will create 10 million jobs with a proven strategy built on a simple principle: We should reward work, make sure Americans have a chance to work, and get ahead when they do.\nThat's why we can cut taxes for businesses that do right by America and reward companies for creating jobs here instead of for moving jobs overseas. If a company is torn between creating jobs here or overseas, we now have a tax code that tells you to go overseas. That's wrong. And if I am President, it will end.\nWe'll put the federal government back in line with our values as well, by capping spending and getting rid of programs that don't work. I believe the private sector is the engine of economic growth, and that instead of being a burden to business, government has a duty to help business succeed.\nResponsibility must begin in Washington, not end there. When I first came to the Senate in 1985, the federal deficit was soaring, as it is today. I stood up to others in my party to join reformers like Warren Rudman and Fritz Hollings to push for a deficit reduction plan with real teeth. In 1993, and again in 1997, I joined President Clinton to put the nation's house in order and balance the budget for the first time since Vietnam.\nNow, our budget is a mess again and we must fix it to keep our country strong. My plan calls for no new spending without cutbacks to pay for that spending. My plan will end corporate welfare as we know it, roll back the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, and impose a real cap on spending. When I put forward a new idea, I'll tell you how I'm going to pay for it. As I have already shown in this campaign, I won't just hold everyone else's proposals to that tough standard; I will apply it to my own.\nThird, I will say to America's middle class, and all who wish to join its ranks: I have a plan to raise your income and a commitment to cut your taxes.\nOn this President's watch, Americans are working harder, earning less, and paying more for health care and college and taxes. The average American family is making $1,400 less a year; we've lost 2.6 million private sector jobs; and the industries that are expanding pay an average of $9,000 less than ones that are contracting. Families are paying $800 more a year for health care, and $1,000 more to send their children to college.\nMeanwhile, the Bush Administration has engineered the greatest tax shift in American history. Middle-class Americans are now paying more of the national budget; wealthy Americans are paying less. The middle class burden has gone up, while incomes have gone down. That's why to build a strong economy, I'll cut middle-class taxes, so middle-class incomes go up.\nThroughout this campaign, I have disagreed with those in my own party who would take away the middle class tax cuts many of us fought for. My economic plan cuts middle-class taxes by three times as much as George Bush. My plan makes it easier for millions of families to pay for health care, and gives families a tax credit on up to $4,000 in college tuition. Under my plan, 98% of Americans and 99% of American businesses will get a tax cut.\nUnlike this President, I have a health care plan that goes after health care costs that are killing American jobs and burdening American families, and an energy plan to hold down costs and make America energy independent.\nFourth, I will keep faith with America's middle class by ushering in a new era of reform. I've been a reformer throughout my career. But I know that the job of a reformer is never done. Since I came to the Senate, I've been fighting for reform on every front. I crossed party lines to support Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget reform in 1985, when fiscal discipline was a dirty word in my own party.\nI took what I had learned as a prosecutor, and fought to pass the 100,000 cops program. We changed the way we fight crime in America - and helped cut violent crime by a third.\nWhen my party was divided over welfare, I voted to pass a landmark welfare reform law with tough work requirements and time limits. We cut the welfare rolls in half, cut poverty in single-parent households by a third, and made welfare a second chance, not a way of life.\nWhen both parties and this administration dragged their feet on political reform, I kept fighting till we passed it - and I'm the only senator ever to run four times without taking a dime of PAC money.\nTogether, I know that we can build a stronger America with real reforms that get real results. I will continue to fix our political system by fighting for campaign finance reform. I will work hard to find more ways for our government to work better for our people. I will shine a light on the secret deals in Washington by reinstating the 5-year ban on lobbying so that government officials cannot cash in with influence peddling and by making sure meetings are open.\nI will reform out of control spending by putting in place budget caps that assure Washington has to live within its means. I will cut waste and abuse out of our health care system by giving incentives for smarter more efficient systems.\nI will reform corporate America by requiring corporations to report to their shareholders and what they report to the IRS. And I will reform our tax code by ending incentives for companies to send jobs overseas.\nGovernment should take less money from the middle class, and do more to make sure their hard-earned tax dollars go to solve their real problems\nFor example, we have to invest more on health care if we're going to keep businesses from cutting jobs and going under. But putting more money into the health care system won't do any good if we don't reform it to get health costs under control-which is exactly what my plan does.\nWe know that education is the key to opportunity in America and the way to get ahead in the 21st Century. This President has broken the promise of education reform by failing to keep up Washington's end of the bargain. But my plan will do more: investing more in our public schools and expecting more from them in return. My plan will cut taxes to help middle-class families send their children to college, but it also includes reforms to make college affordable again, after three years of the steepest tuition inflation on record.\nWe need to take these steps to help our working families and we need to make sure that they are paid for. And I will pay for my education and health care plans by rolling back the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy.\nWe need to work together to bring opportunity back to America so that our country can grow stronger. I am a Democrat who believes, like Franklin Roosevelt, my test is not whether an idea is Republican or Democrat, but whether it will work.\nOn all the issues I've talked about today, the country faces the choice of whether we want to go forward toward strength, or defend the status quo. But to move America forward, no president, and no government can shoulder this burden alone. We cannot be a stronger nation unless the American people do their part. I will never forget the words of the man who inspired me to public life. John Kennedy gave America a set of challenges, not promises, and said what he offered us mattered less than what he would ask of us.\nAmerica is more than a nation; it is an idea, based on the belief in the dignity and duty of every citizen - that all of us have something to give, and each of us has a responsibility to serve.\nThis is the time for all of us to summon that American spirit to build a stronger country. And I know that the American people are ready. That is why I am running for President. The American people are just waiting to hear their country's call. And when they report to do their part, what a glorious morning for America it will be. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2004-04-23", "title": "\"A Contract with Americas Middle Class\": Remarks of John Kerry"}

I wish I had been able to make it to Wheeling on Saturday and go to The Capital Music Hall. Not just because it is a national treasure and so many of the best country/western singers have filled that hall, but because I wanted to hear \"Asleep at the Wheel\" play. I had no idea that the President and the Vice President had started a band.\nI want to thank Senator Rockefeller for that kind introduction, and it's an honor to start my \"Jobs First Bus Tour\" in West Virginia. Before I begin to talk about my plan to build a stronger American economy by enforcing our trade agreements, and I want to take a moment to comment and thank the Governor for leading us in that moment of silence in honor of Marine Lance Corporal Michael J. Smith.\nHere in West Virginia and across the country the stakes have never been higher when more than 100,000 of our men and women are serving their country right now. We think of them when we see the flag or when we sing our national anthem. And when we see those flagged draped coffins bringing our fallen home, we are overwhelmed with pride and pain at the same time.\nWe are proud of their service. We're proud of the way our soldiers care for those on their final trip home. And we're pained to know that yet another American family is filled with grief like the Smith family here in West Virginia.\nNo matter what our differences are about how we got to Iraq, we are united in supporting our troops. We're lucky to have the best-trained and motivated military in the world, and their service is their gift to a grateful nation. And each one of us here today stands shoulder-to-shoulder with our men and women who stand in harm's way at this hour.\nEarlier today, I stood with some of the Tri-State Area's best in the mine. And I want to thank the Mine Worker's for their endorsement this morning. I am lucky to have their support, and I look forward to finding a long-term financial solution to the coal miners retiree health care program. And I look forward to coming back to West Virginia, visiting the coalfields, and talking about my plan to invest in clean coal technology.\nBeing able to spend time with them this morning, reminded me that our workers, the men and women who build this country every day, are heroes too. They live lives of quiet inspiration, taking care of their families. The best part about running for president is that you get to meet so many of them. You get to stand with them, shake their hands, and share their concerns and hopes about their country.\nWe all know that America is at its best when it's at work. When the men and women of West Virginia and across America, can wake up and go to work and make the things that we count on and need—that the world counts on and needs. Whether its cars or computers or clothes, our country is strong when the machines are running, products are being made, and people are cashing paychecks to care for their families. That's the rhythm, that's the sound, of a strong American economy. And in three short years, that sound has been silenced in far too many communities in our country.\nIt is time for us to get our economy back in line with our values. What does that mean? It means not rewarding companies that send jobs overseas, but rewarding those that keep jobs here. We have lost 2.8 million manufacturing jobs—10,000 here in West Virginia—and many of those jobs have gone overseas.\nBut I have a comprehensive economic growth plan that will create 10 million new jobs here at home, including 56,000 here in West Virginia. And we need a strategy to ensure that they are good, high paying jobs that allow parents to raise their family with security and dignity.\nThat's why I announced recently one step to end the insane practice of giving companies tax incentives to move jobs overseas. And we will use the savings to cut taxes for 99 percent of businesses that want to expand and create jobs here at home. Today, if a company is torn between creating jobs here or overseas, we now have a tax code that tells you to go overseas. That's wrong. And when I am President, it will end.\nThis is just basic common sense. We need to apply the same kind of fairness when it comes to enforcing our trade agreements.\nBut I want to be clear. America must always engage in the global economy. We must always look for new markets to sell our products. When we engage with the world on a leveling playing field, no country prospers more than ours.\nWe need to trade. We always have. America is the strongest economy in the world because we've traded for our entire history. It's what transformed New York and New York Harbor after the American Revolution. It's what prompted the building of the Erie Canal to move goods and services west to Ohio and beyond. It sparked our sense of discovery and inspired Lewis and Clarke to find the Northwest Passage. And trade has helped us connect with other countries after the Iron Curtain fell.\nTrade brings us to the world and the world back to us. It connects us and we won't ever stop.\nNow some may disagree with this, and that's okay. But I think we can all agree that we must enforce these trade agreements on terms that are fair, in line with our basic values, and help our workers and businesses compete. When we agree to a trade agreement, the American people deserve to have other nations live up to their side of the bargain.\nWe have rules for a reason and they need to be enforced. The American people deserve to know what they are facing when it comes to our trade policies.\nAmerican workers are willing to compete, but they don't want to be hurt by their own government that rewards companies that ship their jobs overseas. They're willing to compete, but don't want to be hurt by their own government that turns a blind-eye to China and other country's that don't keep their part of the bargain. They're willing to compete, but don't want to be hurt by their own government that ignores abusive child labor practices, suppression of worker rights, destruction of the environment, and other violations of basic universal rights.\nJust because we live in a global economy, it does not mean that we leave our standards and values and ideals at our nation's shores.\nTo engage and win in the global economy, we must not only open markets, we must ensure a level playing field for American workers. As with most economic issues that impact American jobs and American workers, when it comes to enforcing our trade laws, this administration has been asleep on the job.\nThis Administration seems to think that everything is just fine the way things are. We don't and the numbers and reports of trade violations show that we need a new outlook when it comes to our trade policies.\nHere are the facts. We have a $500 billion trade deficit. Because of our fiscal deterioration, we are reliant on foreign creditors. Forty percent of our public debt is now held outside the country—more than 20 percent with China and Japan. Foreign investment has gone from a net inflow of over $40 billion in 2001 to a net outflow of nearly $65 billion in 2003. We are no longer sticking up for workers and we've gone from filing on average 11 cases with the World Trade Organization a year during 1995-200 to just about 3 per year in this Administration.\nThis administration continues to stand by as China manipulates its currency. We put in special China safeguards against harmful trade surges, and this Administration waited 17 months to act as hundreds of thousands lost jobs. They waited 17 months before they even bothered to issue the procedures to tell American companies how to apply for relief. And we've seen software piracy in India rise 40 percent costing our companies $500 million last year with little action from our own government.\nYou don't need a Phd. in economic trade policy to realize that there's no balance here and that the scales have already tipped.\nWhatever the differences that some of us may have on trade; all of us can agree that our trade agreements and trade laws must be enforced. That is not a philosophical question about free trade or protectionism; it is just a common sense question—why aren't we enforcing our own laws on behalf of our own workers and businesses.\nThis Administration thinks that things are moving along just fine. We're seeing job after job shipped overseas, with net job losses on our shores and that's just fine. We see too many workers taking new jobs at lower wages with less health benefits, and they think that is just fine. We're seeing our own workers lose benefits and the average family income has dropped by $1,400 a year and that doesn't concern them either.\nWhen I am president, we will take every step we need to make America competitive. We will not turn a blind eye to clear trade violations when American jobs are on the line. When we enter an agreement, those countries will know that they must live up to their part of the bargain. All new trade agreements will include enforceable labor and environmental provisions in the core of the agreement. We will create a level playing field for our workers and our businesses.\nFirst, I'll call for immediate reinstatement of the of the \"Super 301\" process to bring down the foreign trade barriers that are hurting American industries and their workers.\nOne of the key provisions in our trade agreement with China is a safeguard that provides protections when Chinese imports in a certain sector grow too rapidly. Every time the bipartisan International Trade Commission (ITC) has recommended to the president that the safeguard be used to protect a domestic industry, he has said no. Even when the ITC's recommendation to protect American companies was unanimous the president said \"No.\"\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission unanimously voted to impose safeguards on steel wire garment hangers from China after Chinese hanger imports grew by 800%. One of the petitioners, Cleaners Hanger Company, has a facility in Cleveland and its parent company is also headquartered in Cleveland. The Administration rejected their request for relief. When I'm president, we will not turn our back on those workers and their families.\nSecond, I will order an immediate 120-day review of all existing trade agreements to ensure that our trade partners are living up to their obligations, that trade agreements are being enforced, and that they are working as anticipated. If they're not, I'll take necessary steps to ensure they are. And we won't sign any new agreements until the review is complete and the recommendations are put in place.\nThird, I will step-up action to strengthen workers rights and stamp out child labor. I call on the Administration to immediately investigate China's repression of worker rights, and report back before this election. We will create an annual review that will establish core labor rights around the world. And while this administration seeks every year to gut the funding for fighting abusive child labor standards and promoting internationally recognized worker rights, I will increase those efforts by 50% in my first budget.\nFourth, I will double the United States Trade Representatives trade enforcement budget to actively pursue our trading interests and aggressively file cases with the WTO where appropriate.\nFifth, I will create a Small Business Advocacy Office in the USTR to make it easier for small and medium sized businesses to access our trade law.\nAnd finally, I will launch a no-nonsense effort to stop the illegal currency manipulation that's going on in countries like China and Japan. I won't wait three years to get tough—I will get tough on day one because our jobs and people's livelihoods are on the line.\nThese new trade enforcement policies won't build a wall around America. They'll build a stronger economy for America. An economy where our businesses and workers can compete, and an economy that no longer leaves our ideals about values, fairness, safety, and human rights at home. Just like the things we make every day in America, what American stands for is something worth trading with the world as well.\nThere are rules in these trade agreements for a reason. They are there to level the playing field so that everyone can compete on equal ground. It gives our workers the chance to compete anytime, anywhere, and it gives our businesses the same chance as well. And these steps will do that for our economy. These steps will move America toward economic strength for our workers and business owners, and the worlds'.\nWe must never forget what trade is fundamentally about--people. Trade is about the factory worker in Wheeling who wants to know if he or she can count on having a job next month or next year? Trade is about the factory owner who wants to know if our laws are going to be enforced or if he or she has to continue to do business at a disadvantage. Trade is about people buying and selling our products. And trade is about those who suffer when agreements and standards are ignored.\nAs your president, I will enforce our trade agreements because American workers and our businesses are the best in the world. And they need to know that they have an equal chance to prove that they are second to none.\nHere in Wheeling, the step that launched a new era of trade was the building of a single bridge—the suspension bridge in 1849. It crossed the Ohio River so that the things you made could cross America. Sometimes all it takes is one action or one idea that kicks open the door to economic opportunity and prosperity.\nIf we approach trade in the right way, it can be a source of hope again in America. It can create new jobs and new companies. It can revitalize whole communities. I can make America the global leader in the industries of the future.\nBut most of all, it can strengthen places like Wheeling. So that once again, the economy can work to strengthen the hopes and dreams of working people here in America and all over the world.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2004-04-26", "title": "Remarks in Wheeling, West Virginia"}

Sixty years ago she traveled to Atlantic City to speak her mind at the 1964 Convention.\nSome thought it was a gamble, but we know it was a gift – a gift that reminded us that our work to make this country stronger never ends. When she said, \"I'm so tired of being sick and tired,\" it echoed across this land. She moved this nation toward greater equality. She's more than a memory for us; she's with us today. And she will be with us in Boston in July.\nIf you want to know what's going on in America, then you talk to a mayor.\nI have a great mayor back in Boston, Tom Menino. You can call him anytime and talk about education, housing, and how the Red Sox's keep breaking our hearts. You can catch him at a park opening, a couple of ribbon cuttings, meetings with local business leaders, at a graduation ceremony, swearing in new police officers, at a transportation meeting, a dance for seniors, and that's just an example of half of his day.\nAnd I also have a great mayor in DC, Mayor Williams.\nMayors do a lot because they see a lot. In tough times and in good times, the government that's closest to us is the one we count on the most. Every day you see things I wish everyone in Washington could see.\nOn any given day – whether it's in Hattiesberg or Evanston or right here in Philadelphia with our friend Mayor Street – mayors see setbacks and success, problems and possibilities.\nYou see vacant lots transformed into new buildings that bring more jobs and life to a once forgotten corner. You see kids down the street who were once forgotten – written off hopeless by others – change their lives simply because they have a safe place to go after-school. You see abandoned buildings turned into new homes for working families who have been priced out of this housing market. You see long-time businesses working with neighbors to keep area local economy alive. You see how new bus routes, subway lines, and trains connect neighborhoods to opportunities in the heart of downtown.\nCities and towns, you see, are the heart and soul of America, and mayors on the frontlines are America's conscience.\nAnd when I am president, I will convene an annual meeting of the nation's mayors – not just to hear from our big cities, but to hear from our leaders in our small and rural towns across America.\nAnd together we can build a stronger America: if the partnership between Washington and you is strong; if there's real respect between the federal government and the local government, and if there's a fundamental understanding that Washington can't work unless you can do your work.\nThe ideology that \"you're on your own\" is bound to fail пїЅ both for your cities and towns, and the nation пїЅ because you and I know that we're all in this boat together. But how can we make America stronger when the leadership in Washington won't even acknowledge that something is wrong?\nThey can't even see that it's wrong to reward companies for shipping jobs out of your neighborhood and overseas. That it's wrong to stand by as families and businesses watch health care premiums shoot through roof while the big drug companies and insurance companies get sweetheart deals. That it's wrong when big polluters get their way and your kids get asthma in record numbers.\nThat it's wrong when we've got schools with just one computer for every 15 kids. That it's wrong when millions of Americans are working fulltime and still living in poverty. That it's wrong that we've grown accustomed to using the phrase \"working poor.\" That it's wrong to invest more in prisons than in Head Start.\nThat it's wrong to strong arm the world and send our men and women into harm's way with out the proper body armor and a plan to rebuild a country. That it's wrong to ask our mayors to prevent and protect us in the war on terror and then stick you with the bill. And it's wrong when our leadership divides us for political purposes instead of pulling people together to meet our challenges.\nOur country has faced great challenges in the last four years: a recession that's left millions out of work; an attack that took nearly three thousand lives from us; and today we are a nation at war. But these events are not excuses for what's wrong with America; they are the causes that demand us to make things right.\nAnd together we will make things right again. Together we can build a stronger America: an America that's strong at home and abroad, an America where fundamental fairness, truth, service, and an equal chance for all – not the privileged few – rule the day.\nThat's what we believe in. That's what we want for our country – not just for now, but for our kids, our grandkids, and the generations that follow.\nWe can start by building a stronger economy. We all know that America is at its best when it's at work. When men and women across America can wake up and go to work and make the things that we count on and need.\nWhether its cars or computers, our country is strong when the machines are running, products are being made, and people are cashing paychecks to care for their families.\nThat's the rhythm, that's the sound, of a strong American economy. And in three short years, that sound has been silenced in far too many communities in our country.\nFor the last six weeks, I've been talking about my plan to create 10 million new good paying jobs, cut the deficit in half in 4 years so we can invest more in the things you need to do. Like $25 billion for education, health care, roads and infrastructure and other priorities of yours such as direct funding for you to cover the costs of protecting America in the war on terror.\nThis week I took a \"Jobs First Bus Tour\" across West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.\nI talked about my plan to create the jobs of the future by investing in manufacturing and training. I announced my plan to enforce our trade agreements to keep America strong and competitive around the world.\nWe must always trade and engage in the global economy. But it's hard to compete when the leaders in Washington don't see that it's a problem when countries like China fail to live up to their promises.\nAnd it's hard to make America strong when our leaders think that outsourcing millions of jobs is \"good\" for our economy. That's why I've called for a stop to the insane practice of giving companies tax incentives to export our good paying jobs. It's wrong, and when I'm president it will stop and 99 percent of our companies will get a tax break for keeping jobs here.\nWe see the problem, and together we know what can be done to make sure that our economy is stronger and in line with our values.\nYou and I also know that in order to make America strong, we must lift up our working middle class families and all who aspire to join it.\nWe know that a shift has occurred in America. Families with both parents working used to be able to save for retirement, to buy house or put their child through college. Now they can barely pay for the necessities. They face mounting debt. Health care premiums keep climbing –  as much as 49 percent over the last three years. Bankruptcies are at an all time high. Predatory lenders are taking people's homes. And this year 220,000 young people – smart qualified kids – gave up on their dream to go to college because they couldn't afford it.\nSo to make America's middle class stronger, I have proposed a new \"Contract with the Middle Class\" to help them get ahead, cover health care costs, and pay college tuitions. My plan will make sure that their taxes go down, so their incomes go up. And when I am president 98% of all Americans will get a tax cut, not just the privileged few.\nThat's how you build a strong economy. And we will pay for these steps by rolling back the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\nIn Mississippi and Georgia – in every state I've been to – working families come up to me and tell me about their struggles with health care costs. We all know that we can strengthen our health care system by keeping costs low.\nParents are worried that their employers might drop coverage. And they're worried that one medical emergency could ruin everything they built for their kids. Health care in this country shouldn't be a luxury; it should be a right. My plan would cut health care premiums by up to $1,000 for a family, cutting the cost for businesses, and making it more affordable for America's families.\nWe all know that a strong education is the ticket to a better future in America.\nAmerica is strong when our schools at every grade level have the books, supplies and safe classrooms. When good teachers can do their jobs, and the principal can guide that school the best way they know how. You see the struggles at the local level; our present leadership in Washington doesn't get it.\nYou know that empty slogans lead to empty dreams. But if we make the commitment together, Washington and our local schools can make things right.\nWe will invest in education so that young people can achieve their dream and our workers can remain the best-trained workforce in the world. I have a plan that addresses the high-cost of college with a tax credit on $4000 of tuition. And I have a plan that will pay for college if hundreds of thousands of young people serve their communities: by mentoring kids, building homes, and defending the homeland.\nThis is what we can do for our cities and towns пїЅ and our country. This administration thinks that things are just fine today. They don't even seem to know what's happening.\nBut we do. And we want to work together and make America strong again.\nAnd nothing is more important to our national strength and future than winning the war on terror.\nWe know that progress has been made since those dark days in September. We have gone after the terrorists in Afghanistan, cracked down on their funding networks, and after months of Administration resistance, created a Homeland Security Department.\nBut we know that we haven't done enough.\nAnd I want to talk about a few specific steps we can take today and make us safer and better prepared.\nEvery report that comes out of Washington – whether the Hart-Rudman reports or other independent reviews – the language is clear. They don't use words like: if or perhaps or maybe or an attack might happen again. The constant word is when.\nSo if we know it's a matter of when, then when are we going to stop pretending that all has been accomplished in our shared mission to keep America safe? When are we going to start dealing with dangers we still face? When are we going to secure our ports so we know if nuclear material is coming in on a ship? When are we going to address the fact that our borders are still wide open? When are we going to get the FBI in the habit of letting your local law enforcement know what's going on? When are we going to consolidate our databases so that when one of your cops or sheriffs happens to pull over a suspected terrorist, he actually finds out about it.\nI have a plan to accomplish many of these steps пїЅ and I will continue to address what we can do together to prevent another attack. This is an area in which we can never stop trying to do better. And I believe that our tribute to those who perished from this earth that September day is to create an America that is safer and therefore stronger – an America that has exerted all its might and muscle to prevent another terrorist's attack.\nI don't accept the notion that we've accomplished enough. We have to do more, and I don't think it's right for mayors to bear these costs alone. Since September 11th, you have met your responsibilities – paying more than $3 billion from your own budgets.\nOf the federal money that's provided set aside for a portion of costs for equipment and overtime and training, very little has actually reached your police departments and fire departments. And that has to change, and I will make sure it does when I am President.\nWe don't have a second to spare. The General Accounting just reported that security upgrades at nuclear weapons sites are as many as three years behind. We must do better.\nTime is not on our side when it comes to stopping the next terrorist attack, and I have a plan that will secure our chemical plants across this country.\nAccording to recent reports, al Qaeda affiliated groups were planning an assault on a chemical plant in Jordan. The FBI has warned us that al Qaeda may attempt to launch conventional attacks on our nuclear and chemical industries. And of course our own leaders in Washington warned us that terrorist may strike again before the November election?\nWhat are we waiting for?\nLook at Philadelphia. According to the Environmental protection agency there are seven plants in the area, most of them chemical plants. And if they are attacked – they could kill or injure as many as 1 million people. In Memphis, TN, Vertex Chemicals Manufacturing has 180,000 lbs of Chlorine 25 miles from 1 million people. And in Detroit, Michigan, PVS Technology, Chemicals Manufacturing, has 180,000 lbs of Chlorine 14 miles from 2 million people.\nThere are more than 100 plants like these across America. And we know these plants are not secure. 60 Minutes did a long investigation – they found you could walk right on in, no questions asked. That's what many reporters have found.\nMy colleague, Senator John Corzine, has been a leader on this issue since the early days after 9/11. But it still isn't done. Think about that for a minute. It's nearly 2 and a half years after 9/11 пїЅ and the Administration is still dragging its heels and we're still fighting to secure our chemical plants. I wish their policies were as tough as their words.\nWhy won't they lead this nation to take every step to prevent one of our own chemical plants from being turned into a weapon of mass destruction against our own people?\nHere's what we have to do together – real commonsense steps that will make the difference. Start by putting America's security ahead of the chemical plant's interests.\nWe need to require those plants at the highest risk of an attack to have an effective security force, a protected perimeter, and up to date surveillance. And while we will give these plants the lead in developing and implementing their security plans, we will stand ready to require better security under penalty of law.\nWe have to harden targets today. This Administration unfortunately has been unwilling to take these steps because they have sided with the chemical industry. We need real leadership – leadership that will stand up to the chemical or nuclear power industry and say: \"You don't have a choice when the safety and security of the American people are at stake.\" We don't care who they're writing campaign checks to. It's time for them to make America stronger.\nAnd it's time for all of us to work together and strengthen our homeland security.\nIt's time for the FBI to get you the information you need on the ground, in time, and before a potential problem becomes a crisis. And we need to make sure that the first responders we count on have what they need if terrorism and tragedy strike us again.\nI want America to be stronger so that we win the war on terror пїЅ at home and abroad. And let me say this: I'm determined that no matter who wins this election in November; the terrorists will lose.\nAnd we all know that the stakes have never been higher for the more than 100,000 men and women serving their country right now. We think of them when we see the flag or when we sing that national anthem. And when we see those flagged draped coffins bringing our fallen home. We're proud of them, proud of their service.\nIn Iraq, failure is not an option. We know that the mission is not accomplished пїЅ and it is time for a new plan. A plan that gives our men and women every piece of equipment and every armored vehicle they need so they can do their job. And we will lead again пїЅ with our allies and the world пїЅ with strength and conviction to get this mission right.\nWe must show this kind of leadership to bring other's to join in the effort to build a stable Iraq пїЅ because this historic responsibility is the world's to share, not ours to shoulder alone. Whether it's a stable Iraq or the War on Terror, every country has a stake in the outcome.\nAfter four years of a policy that has pushed the world aside, it's time for a policy that makes us stronger by rebuilding our alliances. When America works with the world, it's a sign of strength, not weakness.\nThe challenges before us are not easy. They will call for us to sacrifice and work together as never before. But the strength of America has always come from the will, the soul and the unity of our people.\nI have seen this all my life. We are nation that is devoted to service. My father joined the army Air Corps in World War II and I was born at an army hospital in Denver.\nMillions of Americans at that time were giving up the comfort of their lives to answer their country's call.\nEven at a young age, my mother taught me about taking care of our environment long before it was a mainstream idea. She'd even wake me up and take me on nature walks and when we were in the middle of the woods, stop and say \"just listen.\"\nWell, I am wide-awake now about what we need to do to preserve our environment and become more energy independent. Moments like the ones I shared with her stay with you – and instill a value to honor God's gift and pass on something better to our children and theirs.\nEven in college, the call to service was all around me. The Peace Corps was new пїЅ and some of our oldest ideals were at stake in the struggle for civil rights. There were busloads of freedom riders who went to Mississippi to register new voters. And when I graduated from Yale, I just thought it was my duty to volunteer for Vietnam.\nThirty-five years ago, on a boat, in the Mekong Delta, I grew up with a band of brothers from all walks of life and every corner of America. We learned many things on that journey, but above all, we learned that we were never the kid from South Carolina, Iowa, Arkansas, California, or the kid from Massachusetts. Under the heat of fire and the fog of battle, our mission became crystal clear пїЅ and color, religion, and background melted away to an understanding that we were all simply \"Americans.\" All of us fighting under the same flag, praying to the same God.\nI'm running for President because I believe that we are all in the same boat. I believe that no matter what our differences, we can work together to build a stronger America. We can work together to make our country stronger as we fight and win this war on terror.\nWe can make our economy stronger so that it works to fulfill the hopes and dreams of working families. Instead of outsourcing our jobs, we can build our industrial strength.\nInstead of leaving millions of children behind, we can make our schools stronger so that every child has a chance to reach their God-given talents. And instead of doing nothing on health care for people and everything to protect the profits of the big drug companies, we can make tough reforms to keep costs under control.\nThis is what we want for America. This is what we believe in. We can restore fairness, and truth and opportunity again. We can accomplish this when our shared mission is to make our country equal to its high ideals and hopes. Because together, we can and will build a stronger America. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2004-04-29", "title": "Remarks to the National Conference of Black Mayors"}

It is not often in the whirlwind of this campaign that I am able to say yes to an invitation and make good on that commitment within a matter of days. However, these are not ordinary times, and this is no ordinary college.\nWhen President Larkin's predecessor of over fifty years ago, Dr. Frances McCluer, invited Winston Churchill to Westminster in 1946, President Truman not only personally endorsed the invitation, but told the former Prime Minister that he would introduce him here.\nLike the world that Churchill saw in 1946, today's world requires that we recast old assumptions and turn to new approaches if we are to prevail in our historic charge to defend our nation and build a new era of alliances. The common foe we face today is different in every way, but fully as dangerous, as the one that Churchill so famously described here.\nYet Churchill's grand theme is still valid and relevant: The United States, he said, stood \"at the pinnacle of power\" with \"an awe-inspiring accountability to the future.\" He called for a strengthening of the United Nations, and stronger alliances. Talking of the Soviet Union, Churchill spoke words that are still true, in this different time and against a different adversary: \"What they desire is the...indefinite expansion of their power and doctrines...I am convinced that there is nothing they admire so much as strength, and there is nothing for which they have less respect than for weakness, especially military weakness.\"\nOf course, not everyone agreed with Churchill. Rejecting his call for closer ties even with Great Britain, The Wall Street Journal said that \"the United States wants no alliance or anything that resembles an alliance with any nation.\" Well, some things never change.\nWhat was true in 1946 is still true today. America must lead a broad coalition against our adversaries, and we must be a beacon of values as well as strength to succeed. This is our duty, and our obligation to those great leaders of a half century ago who set us on a course to victory in the Cold War, starting here at Fulton.\nSo you don't come to Fulton to give a speech; you come to Fulton to honor a tradition and give the country and the world the gift of hard truths and a sense of hope.\nBoth are needed today as we stand on the eve of an anniversary in this country – the day that major combat operations were declared over in Iraq and the President declared, \"mission accomplished.\"\nI don't think there's anyone in this room today or 6,000 miles away who doesn't wish that those words had been true. But we've seen the news. We've seen the pictures. And we know we are living through days of great danger.\nWhat anniversaries give us is the time to reflect – not about where we have been – but about what might be possible – possible for our men and women in the military, the Iraqi people and our allies around the world.\nThis anniversary is not a time to shout. It is not a time for blame. It is a time for a new direction in Iraq and for America to work together so that once again this nation leads in a way that brings the world to us and with us in our efforts.\nIn the end, America is safer and stronger when it is respected around the world, not feared. To move to that place of promise and possibility, we must all see and share in the hard truths all around us.\nWe know that there is no harder truth than when an American pays the ultimate sacrifice for our country. At this moment, 722 men and women have fallen. Eulogies and rifle salutes and the last lone note of taps have echoed across our towns. The sacrifice is profound, the grief beyond measure, and the country's gratitude is eternal.\nThe hard truth is that we know that more lives will be lost until the mission is truly accomplished, and our duty is to make sure that parents, families, and friends who lost loved ones will know that they did not die in vain.\nWe also know that for more than 135,000 families the ongoing burden of this mission is something they feel every day. The truth is there's an empty seat in the church pew on Sunday, an extra car in the driveway, and one less friend to phone for a movie on Friday night.\nAnd the reasons that summoned Americans to service vary. It might be the story of a young man or woman called to duty in the wake of September 11th or by a family tradition of service to country. Or it may be a small businessperson who is called to Reserve or National Guard duty, first for a few weeks and now indefinitely.\nThey answered the call of service, they did their duty. But we now know that our military was sent into battle without the right equipment. Helicopter pilots have flown battlefield missions without the best available anti-missile systems.\nWe now know that roughly one-fourth of coalition deaths have occurred as a result of attacks on unarmored vehicles because we don't have enough armed vehicles to go around. We now know that our failure to forge and lead a true coalition has forced thousands in the National Guard and Reserves to be away from families and jobs for more than a year with no end in sight. And we now know that civilians from half a dozen allied countries have been kidnapped. Hundreds of Iraqi civilians have been murdered in terrorist attacks.\nIn addition, many of the Iraqi military and police, whom we trained, have refused to fight. Extremists in major cities are rallying, challenging our resolve, and vowing to drive us out.\nThis moment in Iraq is a moment of truth. Not just for this administration, the country, the Iraqi people, but for the world. This may be our last chance to get this right. We need to put pride aside to build a stable Iraq.\nWe must reclaim our country's standing in the world by doing what has kept America safe and made it more secure before – leading in a way that brings others to us so that we are respected, not simply feared, around the globe.\nThis will not be easy, a hard truth that sometimes fails to get through the news papers and daily reports. But we can accomplish the mission. And we must. Because I can tell you from personal experience, we owe it to the brave men and women who stand in harm's way at this moment.\nIn America, we're blessed. When you stop and think about what it takes for those individuals who risk their lives, say good-bye to their families, and go so far away to serve their country –  it is a profound gesture of honor.\nIt symbolizes the spirit of America – that there are men and women who are ready to do what it takes to live and lead by our values. I met so many of them when I fought in Vietnam and I have met them since from Desert Storm, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraqi Freedom. Their love of country and sense of duty, is special. You carry it with you always. And it is because of them and those who carry on today, that together we have got to do what it takes to get this done right.\nWe have got to come together as never before to build a stable Iraq. Not just to finish the mission, but to remind the world that a shared endeavor can bring the world closer toward peace.\nAs complicated as Iraq seems, there are really only three basic options: One, we can continue to do this largely by ourselves and hope more of the same works; Two, we can conclude it's not doable, pull out and hope against hope that the worst doesn't happen in Iraq; Or three, we can get the Iraqi people and the world's major powers invested with us in building Iraq's future.\nMistakes have complicated our mission and jeopardized our objective of a stable free Iraq with a representative government, secure in its borders. We may have differences about how we went into Iraq, but we do not have the choice just to pick up and leave – and leave behind a failed state and a new haven for terrorists.\nI believe that failure is not an option in Iraq. But it is also true that failure is not an excuse for more of the same.\nHere is how we must proceed.\nFirst, we must create a stable and secure environment in Iraq. That will require a level of forces equal to the demands of the mission. To do this right, we have to truly internationalize both politically and militarily: we cannot depend on a US-only presence. In the short-term, however, if our commanders believe they need more American troops, they should say so and they should get them.\nBut more and more American soldiers cannot be the only solution. Other nations have a vital interest in the outcome and they must be brought in.\nTo accomplish this, we must do the hard work to get the world's major political powers to join in this mission. To do so, the President must lead. He must build a political coalition of key countries, including the UK, France, Russia and China, the other permanent members of the UN Security Council, to share the political and military responsibilities and burdens of Iraq with the United States.\nThe coalition should endorse the Brahimi plan for an interim Iraqi government, it should propose an international High Commissioner to work with the Iraqi authorities on the political transition, and it should organize an expanded international security force, preferably with NATO, but clearly under US command.\nOnce these elements are in place, the coalition would then go to the UN for a resolution to ratify the agreement. The UN would provide the necessary legitimacy. The UN is not the total solution but it is a key that opens the door to participation by others.\nIn parallel, the President must also go to NATO members and others to contribute the additional military forces and to NATO to take on an organizing role. NATO is now a global security organization and Iraq must be one of its global missions.\nTo bring NATO members and others in, the President must immediately and personally reach out and convince them that Iraqi security and stability is a global interest that all must contribute to. He must also convince NATO as an organization that Iraq should be a NATO mission – a mission consistent with the principles of collective security that have formed the basis of the alliance's remarkable history in the pursuit of peace and security.\nTo bring others in it is imperative we share responsibility and authority. When NATO members have been treated with respect, they have always – always – answered the call of duty. So too with other key contributors. Every one has a huge stake in whether Iraq survives its trial by fire or is consumed by fire and becomes a breeding ground for terror, intolerance and fear.\nI know that some will say that this is an impossible task, but I believe it is doable with the right approach. We must lead but we must listen. We must use every tool of diplomacy and persuasion to bring others along.\nI also understand that perhaps NATO cannot undertake the entire Iraq mission right away. But it could possibly take control of Iraq's borders, take responsibility for Northern Iraq and/or the Polish sector, and train Iraq's army. If NATO did this, it would free up as many as 20,000 American troops, and open the door for other countries outside of NATO to participate.\nThe immediate goal is to internationalize the transformation of Iraq, to get more foreign forces on the ground to share the risk and reduce the burden on our own forces. That is the only way to succeed in the mission while ending the sense of an American occupation.\nWe must take these steps because there is greater strength in greater numbers and stronger alliances. And failure to move forward will be seen as a failure of American leadership.\nSecond:\nThe second key element is the High Commissioner. Backed by a newly broadened security coalition, he should be charged with overseeing elections, the drafting of a constitution and coordinating reconstruction. The Commissioner should be highly regarded by the international community and have the credibility to talk to all the Iraqi people.\nThis Commissioner should be directed to work with Iraq's interim government, the new US Ambassador, and the international community after June 30 to ensure a process that continues to move forward on the path toward sovereignty, while focusing on the immediate needs of the Iraqis themselves.\nThe Iraqi people desperately need financial and technical assistance that is not swallowed up by bureaucracy and no-bid contracts, but instead goes directly into the hands of grassroots organizations. They need to see the tangible benefits of reconstruction in the form of jobs, infrastructure, and services. And they need to be able to communicate their concerns to international authorities without feeling they are being insulted and disrespected in their own country.\nThird:\nWe need a massive training effort to build Iraqi security forces that can actually provide security for the Iraqi people. We must accept that the effort to date has failed: it must be rethought and reformed. Training cannot be hurried. It must be done in the field and on the job as well as in the classroom. Units cannot be put on the street without backup from international security forces. They cannot be rushed into battle before they are ready.\nThis is a task to do in partnership with other nations, not just on our own. This is a task which must be successful. If we fail to create viable Iraqi security forces – military and police – there is no successful exit for us and other nations.\nBut why would others join a cause that they did not support in the first place? For one simple reason: it's in their self-interest. For the Europeans, Iraq's failure could endanger the security of their oil supplies, further radicalize their large Muslim populations, threaten destabilizing refugee flows, and seed a huge new source of terrorism.\nAnd for Iraq's neighbors, a civil war in Iraq could draw them in, put moderates in the region on the defensive and radicals on the rise. And a civil war could threaten the regimes in Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia.\nThese compelling interests have always existed and they must now be the central piece of a diplomatic effort long overdue. Will a new approach in Iraq be difficult to achieve? Yes.\nIs there a guarantee of success? No.\nIn light of all the mistakes that have been made, no one can say that success is certain, but I can say that if we do not try, failure is all too likely.\nIf the President will take the needed steps to share the burden and make progress in Iraq – if he leads – then I will support him on this issue.\nWhen Winston Churchill came to Westminster and defined the great mission of the Cold War, he called on free nations to stand together against tyranny. America's leader in that moment of history was a tough and visionary son of Missouri named Harry Truman. President Truman could have used America's power as an excuse to go it alone in the world. Instead, he joined with the leaders of many nations to create institutions like NATO and other alliances to preserve peace, spur economic progress and address global problems.\nMuch has changed since Churchill spoke. The institutions created more than half a century ago remain useful and relevant. But yesterday's designs are not sufficient to meet today's needs. Our institutions and alliances must adapt to new opportunities and threats. New enemies must be confronted by new strategies. America must lead in new ways.\nBut even as we contemplate what has changed, we must also remember what has not: Our belief in the rights and dignity of every human being. Our faith in democracy as the best form of government in all of human history. And our confidence in America's capability to lead allies and friends to stand together and build a world more peaceful, prosperous and just than we have ever known before.\nThat was our mission in Churchill's time. And for all the differences of time and circumstance, that is our urgent need in Iraq today and our enduring mission in the years ahead.\nThere is pride in that and honor – and if we meet the test, we can have a world that is safer because of American leadership.\nThank you very much.", "timestamp": "2004-04-30", "title": "Remarks at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29688", "text": "Thank you Dick, for that generous introduction. And thank you to the Anti-Defamation League for inviting me here today.\nFor all of its history, your organization has called on people to live by one of the most fundamental and challenging principles in all of human history: you have asked us to be good neighbors.\nFor ninety years, you have reminded us that good neighbors build strong communities. And for ninety years, you have shown that strong communities lead to a safer world.\nI learned that lesson thirty five years ago while living in a different kind of neighborhood halfway across the world. In a small Swift Boat on the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, I grew up with a band of brothers from all walks of life and every corner of America.\nWe learned many things on that boat, but above all, we learned that we weren't the kid from South Carolina, Iowa, Arkansas, California, or the kid from Massachusetts. Under the heat of fire and the fog of battle, color, religion, and background melted away.\nNow, I'm running for President because I believe that we are all in the same boat. I believe we can build a stronger America that stands by its people, all of its people. Where everyone has something to contribute, and everyone counts. Where we never leave anyone behind. And where we know that diversity is our greatest strength. That's the America I want to lead.\nAnd for ninety years, the Anti-Defamation League has been helping to build a stronger America by combating anti-Semitism and bigotry across the world. By asking us to be better neighbors and reminding us that we're all in the same boat.\nWe have so much progress to celebrate this year. Last week, we celebrated the creation of Israel – a nation that was founded fifty-six years ago as a home for those unwelcome elsewhere. In May, we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. And, after last week's conference in Berlin, we celebrate the fifty-five countries who have pledged to intensify their efforts to combat anti-Semitism and spread tolerance. Abe Foxman, who's been a leader on this issue, just returned from that conference, and I look forward to hearing from him on the good work he helped achieve there.\nWhile there is progress, we know there is also great peril. We know that fear can still infect the places where tolerance lives. And, too often, we have seen the light of hope overcome by the shadow of hate.\nFifteen hundred and fifty-seven incidents of anti-Semitism plagued our country last year. African-American and Latino children still attend crumbling schools in the forgotten corners of America. Gay teenagers still live in fear of beatings from their straight classmates. And in Terre Haute, Indiana, a Holocaust museum memorializing children who were victims of Nazi medical experimentation is destroyed by arson. A Holocaust museum memorializing children – think about that.\nAcross the Atlantic, a new anti-Semitism masking as anti-Israeli sentiment is creeping its way across Europe and the Middle East. Scores of Jewish graves, memorials, synagogues and schools have been defaced in places like France and Germany. Jews in these countries who see violence in the Middle East fill their television screens now see it used as a pretext for prejudice against Jewish people everywhere.\nThis feeling of vulnerability is a problem for Jews in many parts of the world. But make no mistake – it is not just a Jewish problem. It is an American problem; it is a European problem; it is an Arab problem; and it is a world problem facing everyone who cherishes tolerance and loves freedom. Because when it comes to battling bigotry, we are all in this together. The resurgence of anti-Semitism throughout Europe must not be tolerated. I have spent my life standing up to prejudice in all of its forms, and I will continue that fight every day of my presidency.\nThere is no greater challenge and no greater danger for civilization today than the ultimate expression of bigotry and hatred: terrorism. Our friends in Israel have lived with terror their entire lives, and on a tragic day three Septembers ago, it was terror that landed on America's doorstep.\nLet me be clear: I will be a President who works with the rest of the world to wipe out the terrorism that threatens our common humanity.\nThe people of Israel should also know that, as President, my commitment to a safe and secure Jewish state will be unwavering. For nineteen years, this is a pledge I have kept in the United States Senate – whether through my votes on economic aid, military security, or the location of the U.S. Embassy. And it is one I will continue to keep over the next four years.\nAfter returning home from war in Vietnam, I've always had the sense that every other day is extra. And my many visits to Israel have shown me how this same sense prevails among some of the world's strongest survivors – the Jewish people.\nBut I never understood this fragility and vulnerability more than when I first visited Israel on an ADL mission so many years ago. For days, my inner-Top Gun sought out a ride in an Israeli Air Force Jet. And when I finally got one, my inner-politician convinced the pilot to let me take control of the plane for awhile. But after a few minutes in the air – a few minutes – the pilot yelled for me to turn the plane around. \"We just got in the air,\" I told him. \"I know,\" he said. \"But if we flew in any other direction for two minutes more, we would be flying into enemy territory.\"\nFrom that moment on, I felt as Israelis do: The promise of peace must be secure before the Promised Land is secure on a thin margin of land.\nThat first trip to Israel made real for me all I'd believed about Israel. I met people of stunning commitment, who honestly and vigorously debated the issues as I watched and listened intently. I went as a friend by conviction; I returned a friend at the deepest personal level.\nWhen I am President of the United States, my promise to the people of Israel will be this:\nWe will never pressure you to compromise your security.\nWe will never expect you to negotiate for peace without a credible partner.\nAnd we will always work to provide the political and military and economic help for your fight against terror.\nUnfortunately, yesterday the Likud voted against Prime Minister Sharon's Gaza withdrawal plan. Prime Minister Sharon's proposal could have been and may still be a step forward for both Israelis and Palestinians. Whatever the future of this particular plan, if elected president, I will work continuously and vigorously with the Israeli government to move forward on this or similar efforts.\nSadly, yesterday also marked the tragic death of another Israeli family when gunmen in Gaza ambushed a pregnant Israeli mother and her four children on their way to exercise their democratic rights and campaign against the referendum. Murdering a pregnant woman and four children ranging in age from 2 to 11 years old -- this terrorism is heart-wrenching and despicable, and the terrorists must be stopped.\nBuilding a stronger Israel and a stronger America means working together to combat the terror that threaten us all. And to improve the cooperation that has existed for years between our two countries, I believe we should establish a new Joint Homeland Security Group that allows America and Israel to share information and expertise in how to better protect our people from attack.\nAfter a long history of oppression, the people of Israel understand that every day is extra. And from the first days of a Kerry Administration, we will stand with them in using every one of those days to bring security to their neighborhoods and make peace with their neighbors.\nWe will fight for a safer world and we will build a stronger America. The first responsibility of the President is to keep America safe and secure. And I will. I'm running because we are in a new kind of war, and we need a commander in chief with a plan to fight this war and win it.\nI will never hesitate to use American power to defend our interests everywhere in the world.\nI will direct our armed forces to bring terrorists to justice anywhere they gather to do us harm. I will never cede our security to any nation or institution, but I will always realize that in a global neighborhood, winning this war depends on restoring diplomacy as a tool of the strong.\nI will never attempt to win this war on the cheap, and I will finally provide the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces what they have not had in Iraq: all of the weapons, the armor, and the equipment they need to do the job we've asked them to do.\nI will, however, force our enemies to wage this war on the cheap. We must do more to cut off the flow of terrorist funds. In the case of Saudi Arabia – a regime that openly and enthusiastically supports Palestinian terrorist groups such as Hamas – the Bush Administration has adopted a kid-glove approach to the laundering of terrorist money.\nWith Saudi-funded hate speech littering the textbooks of children and the Saudi interior minister claiming that \"the Jews\" were responsible for 9/11, our current Administration thinks that our current relationship with this regime is acceptable. I do not – and I intend to be a President who holds Saudi Arabia accountable for its conduct.\nAt the dawn of the 21st century, there are global threats that confront our global village. In the War on Terror, we do not face off just one man or one terrorist network or even the threat of terrorism itself. We face a fundamental struggle of values: democracy against terror, diversity against tyranny.\nLet's be clear: the War on Terror is not a clash of civilizations. It is a clash of civilization against fanaticism; of the progress of humanity against the primitive fears of the few.\nWe can all stand with the Anti-Defamation League in combating anti-Semitism and racism wherever it exists. We can protect religious freedom on the job and protect the line between church and state. We can work to build economies at home and abroad that lift people from the swamps of despair to the high ground of hope. And we can continue to build the bridges between our neighborhoods that strengthen our common humanity.\nToday, there is such a bridge in my hometown of Boston.\nThe Lenny P. Zakim Bridge is a monument to a man who knew that America was stronger when we built it together.\nWhen I needed a guide and a companion on his first trip to Israel, my friend Lenny was there. And whenever bridges were needed to unite the diversity of our neighborhoods and our nation, Lenny was there.\nHe was there to start the first annual black-Jewish Seder, drawing over 600 people of all races and faiths in 1999. He was there to knock down religious barriers, being named a Knight of St. Gregory by Pope John Paul II--one of the highest honors bestowed on lay people by the Catholic Church. And he was there at the end of his life, delaying caner treatments so that he could keep working, keep teaching, keep spreading the values that make us strong.\nYou see, Lenny knew better than anyone that every other day is extra.\nIn a 1999 interview with the Boston Globe, he said: \"We cannot wait for another Moses or Jesus to solve the predicament we find ourselves in today. We have to do it ourselves.\"\nThis is not just the calling of the Anti-Defamation League. This is the calling of all American and all those who believe in our common humanity across this planet.\nI believe we can harness that spirit to lift our own land and the life of the world. I believe that spirit is alive in towns and communities across our country, where people really do know that we are all in this together ... where people want to embrace our differences ... where people are hungry for a leader who once again will summon the best in us.\nIf you lend me your trust, your strength, your voice and your vote, that's exactly the kind of President I will try to be.\nAnd together we will build a stronger America.\nThank you and God bless you.", "timestamp": "2004-05-03", "title": "Remarks to the Anti-Defamation League"}

The most important election in our lifetime ought to be a contest of ideas to lift America up, not a cynics' game to define America down.\nAs governors, mayors, county officials, and state legislators from 40 states, you prove every day that ideas matter. You balance budgets every year, you turn around schools, you keep your people safe. Every day, you do what Washington hasn't done in almost four years-you get real results and make a real difference in the lives of ordinary people.\nIn 2000, when John McCain had him on the run, George Bush made up a slogan: \"Reformer with Results.\" Four years later, Americans are still waiting to see the reformer, but they've had enough of the results!\nThe banner behind me says it all. From the economy and the budget to the public schools and welfare as we know it, the American people deserve Real Reformers and Real Results - and when I'm President, that's finally what they'll get.\nWe all know: The first responsibility of the President is to keep our country safe and secure. That means honoring America's calling to be the strongest force for freedom around the world and the greatest engine of opportunity here at home. That is why I am running for President. And I will never cede the issue of strength to the other party.\nStrength means working with our allies to win the war on terror, not going it alone. Strength means taking responsibility. Today, Secretary Rumsfeld apologized on Capitol Hill. But the chain of command goes all the way to the Oval Office. Harry Truman did not say \"The buck stops at the Pentagon.\" And after 241 Marines were killed by terrorists in Beirut, Ronald Reagan had the strength to say, \"If there is to be blame, it properly rests here in this Office and with this President. And I accept responsibility for the bad as well as the good.\nAmerica does not merely need a new Secretary of Defense. We need a new President. One who is strong enough to give our brave troops the allies and the armor they need; and one who is strong enough to take responsibility and, when necessary, correct course. We need a President who knows the difference between strength – and stubbornness.\nStrength means standing up to the chemical industry to protect our chemical plants from attack, not giving in to big campaign checks. Strength means giving our firefighters and police officers the equipment and training they need to keep us safe, not telling local officials: \"You're on your own.\"\nStrength means lifting up the middle class and giving them the bigger tax break, not just the wealthiest Americans. Strength means having a health care plan that lowers costs, not pretending that nothing's wrong. Strength means ensuring that our kids get a good education, not just in affluent neighborhoods but everywhere. Strength means balancing the budget, not passing on trillions of dollars in debt to our kids. And strength means leading in a way that brings opportunity to all and special privileges to none.\nIt is time America had a president who understands that strength abroad means providing real leadership in the world, and taking responsibility for the bad as well as the good. And strength at home means building a stronger economy by getting results for the American people, and demanding accountability.\nThis is the kind of president we need in Washington, the kind of president I will be. It's not a new way or a third way-it's the right way to lead America and make America strong again.\nOur opponents think that all they have to do is run $60 million in misleading ads. They think we'll back down and we'll cede them the issue of strength. Well, if they think the tired old arguments of the past are going to win in this new world-they guessed wrong. We will debate this Administration on every issue, any time, any place. We're ready because we know that they don't own the flag: they don't own patriotism; they don't own strength. All of these values belong to all of America. And we're going to stand our ground, tell the truth, and fight for a country that lives up to our ideals.\nI have many differences with the administration about the war in Iraq. And one of the greatest differences is that I believe that when America works with the world, it's a sign of strength, not weakness.\nA little more than a year ago, the President declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq and said, \"mission accomplished.\" I don't think there's anyone in this room today or 6,000 miles away who doesn't wish that those words had been true. But we've seen the news. We've seen the pictures. And we know we are living through days of great danger.\nBut this is not the time to shout. It is a time for a new direction in Iraq and for America to work together so that once again this nation leads in a way that brings the world to us and with us in our efforts.\nThis is how America can lead and should lead. And we should be the leaders in condemning those appalling images of abuse that are flashing across television screens all over the world.\nWe cannot succeed in Iraq by abandoning the values that define America. Today, I have a message for our men and women in uniform: As Commander-in-Chief, I will honor your commitment and I will take responsibility for the bad as well as the good.\nWhen I am President, I will demand accountability from those who serve and I will take responsibility for their actions. And I will do everything I can do to repair the damage this has caused to America, to our standing in the world, and for the ideals for which we stand. That is my promise to our troops. That is my promise to our nation.\nIn the end, America is stronger and the American people are safer when we are respected around the world, not just feared. And that's the kind of leadership I'll restore in the White House.\nI am running for president because we have not done enough to win the war on terror. We have to do more to plug big holes in our homeland defense in intelligence, information sharing, and bioterrorism. And in Afghanistan, I believe this administration let its guard down.\nI think they made a huge mistake in relying on local Afghan forces to capture Osama bin Laden, rather than committing sufficient U.S. forces on the ground to do the job.\nAs President, I will never hesitate to use American power to defend our interests anywhere in the world. I will make America's armed forces even stronger by adding troops so our forces are not spread too thin around the globe and by making sure our forces have the armor and support they need.\nTo this day, nothing angers me more than those in the other party who try to claim strength as their issue, even as they shortchange the soldiers and veterans who've kept us strong.\nYou can't honor freedom and forget the men and women who fight and die to keep us free. I will stand up for our country, our flag, and our values, and make it clear that the first definition of patriotism is keeping faith with those who wear the uniform of our country.\nFor 30 years since Vietnam, the other party has tried to frighten voters into thinking that only Republicans care about national security. They attacked us so often that some in our party would rather try to change the subject to the economy than show our real national security strength. Two years ago, I came to the DLC National Conversation in New York to put my party on notice that the terrorists aren't going to change the subject, and we shouldn't, either.\nThe other side was wrong about us then, and they are wrong now. As long as I am its leader, this party will put the strength of America first.\nThroughout this campaign, I have offered a positive vision of how we'll do a better job of keeping Americans safe and restoring America's ability to lead the world. We must follow in the footsteps of great, tough-minded statesman in our party - Wilson, Roosevelt, Truman, and Kennedy, to name a few. That is the great tradition of the DLC and of our party: A strong America depends on a strong American role in the world and an unsurpassed defense.\nWe understand what this Administration does not: America wasn't put here to dominate the world. We have a higher calling: to lead it.\nAmerica and the world need us to lead, because this administration hasn't and it won't. Like the Cold War, the struggle we face today may go on for decades, and once again, the United States must rally the forces of freedom and democracy around the world to defeat this new menace.\nAl Qaeda remains a threat as it transforms and changes, Taliban remnants are launching bolder attacks in Afghanistan, and America's enemy number one -- Osama bin Laden - remains at large. The President's economic policies have weakened America's economic leadership and leverage in the world. And by steering a unilateral course, the administration has bred global mistrust of our motives and unloosed a torrent of anti-Americanism abroad.\nOur military strength may be at an all-time high, but our moral authority around the world is at an all-time low. That's wrong and that's dangerous. As President, I will not rest until America is both the strongest nation on earth and the most respected. Americans have never failed the cause of human freedom, and we will not fail it now-not in Iraq, not in Afghanistan, not anywhere.\nThere is something else this administration just doesn't understand: we can't be strong in the world if we're not strong at home.\nThroughout our history, the middle class has been the moral and economic backbone of this nation. That's why Franklin Roosevelt signed the G.I. Bill to help people go to college, buy a house, and build their wealth. Under Bill Clinton, we created 23 million new jobs, lifted 7 million Americans out of poverty, and sent millions more Americans to college. The middle class built this country. They work hard, pay their bills, and do right by their families and their country. This country ought to do right by them.\nFor four years, this administration has ignored middle-class interests and walked away from those middle-class values. They've put wealth ahead of work, something-for-nothing ahead of responsibility, and special privilege for the few ahead of what's right for the nation.\nThe result? The people who do the work are earning the smallest share of the reward on record. Profits have reached near-record levels, but workers are suffering from a $172 billion wage deficit - the gap between what wages are today and what they would be if they had risen with the economy at the rate they have in the past. That translates into $1,600 a year in lost wages for each household. In America, a rising tide is supposed to lift all boats - but in the Bush tide, the middle-class boat is taking on water.\nI will put the economy and government back in line with our values. We'll create 10 million jobs so Americans have the chance to work and get ahead when they do. We'll cut taxes for businesses that do right by America and reward companies for creating jobs here instead of for moving jobs overseas. I believe the private sector is the engine of economic growth, and our party cannot love jobs and hate the businesses that create them.\nResponsibility must begin in Washington, not end there. We'll stop pretending Washington can live beyond its means and stop making it harder for states to live within theirs. To borrow a line from a certain Halliburton executive back in 2000, whose name escapes me at the moment: \"Help is on the way.\"\nAnd it's never been needed more. Our budget is a mess again and we have to fix it again. My plan will end corporate welfare as we know it, roll back the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, and impose a real cap on spending. When I put forward a new idea, I'll tell you how I'm going to pay for it. As I have already shown in this campaign, I won't just hold everyone else's proposals to that tough standard; I will apply it to my own.\nThis administration has given us the worst of all fiscal worlds- a bigger government that does less and spends more. We've had enough of an administration that has grown the government and shrunk the middle class. The middle-class share of the tax burden has gone up, while incomes have gone down. They are working harder, earning less, and paying more for health care and college and taxes. That's why to build a strong economy, I'll cut middle-class taxes, so middle-class incomes go up.\nThroughout this campaign, I have disagreed with those in my own party who would take away the middle class tax cuts many of us fought for. My plan makes it easier for millions of families to pay for health care, and gives families a tax credit on up to $4,000 in college tuition. Under my plan, 98% of Americans and 99% of American businesses will get a tax cut.\nUnlike this administration, I have a health care plan that goes after health care costs that are killing American jobs and burdening American families, and an energy plan to hold down costs and make America energy independent.\nOn all these issues, we must keep faith with America's middle class by offering a new era of real reforms with real results. I've fought for reform throughout my career.\nI took what I had learned as a prosecutor, and together with Bruce Reed and others, fought to put 100,000 cops on the street. We changed the way we fight crime in America - and helped cut violent crime by a third.\nWhen our party was divided over welfare, I voted to pass a landmark welfare reform law with tough work requirements and time limits. We cut the welfare rolls in half, cut single-parent poverty by a third, and made welfare a second chance, not a way of life.\nWhen both parties and this administration dragged their feet on political reform, I kept fighting till we passed it - and I'm the only senator ever to run four times without taking a dime of PAC money.\nFor years, we've fought for education reform because education is the key to opportunity in America. This President hasn't kept up Washington's end of the bargain. I will keep the promise of education reform by investing more in our public schools and going much further to make sure we get results from them. Earlier this week, I proposed a plan to close the Bush loophole that leaves dropouts at record levels behind. Under my plan, we'll help a minimum of one million more students graduate over the next five years.\nYesterday, I proposed the most far-reaching reforms in teacher pay in our nation's history. I'm offering a new bargain for America's teachers that asks more and rewards them more. If we're going to close the opportunity gap, we have to close the teacher gap, by rewarding good teachers who agree to teach in the places and subjects where we need them most. Instead of starving reform, we'll reward schools and teachers for turning our toughest schools around. Half a century has passed since Brown v. Board of Education. Under my plan, we'll finally be able to insist on a good teacher in every classroom and reward the great teachers who are there today.\nMy college plan will cut taxes to help middle-class families send their children to college, but it also includes reforms to make college affordable again, after three years of the steepest tuition inflation on record. Next week, I'll say more about the steps we must take to reform health care. Putting more money into the health care system won't do any good if we don't reform it to get costs under control - which is exactly what my plan does. I will cut waste and abuse out of our health care system by giving incentives for smarter, more efficient systems.\nFinally, we'll reform our political system and renew our democracy by putting country before party again. The president was right to promise to change the tone in Washington, but four years later we need a new tone more than ever. The reason you've all done so well back home is that you understand what the President forgot: If you want to be a reformer with results, you have to be a uniter, not a divider. Like Franklin Roosevelt, I believe the best test is not whether an idea is Republican or Democrat, but whether it will work. We can't tackle our biggest challenges unless we find ways for leaders in both parties to work together.\nMore than ever, Americans are desperate for us to leave the petty and the partisan behind, and reach for America's higher promise. And the reason is simple: America is more than a piece of geography-more than a name of a country; it is the most powerful idea in human history, freedom and equal opportunity for all. And that idea demands a solemn responsibility from every citizen-that we do all that we can to help realize the promise of America.\nI am running for President to renew that idea and spirit again. With God's blessing, America will stand as strong and reach as high as we're willing to ask of ourselves and hold ourselves accountable.

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29690", "text": "Knights, Chancellor Jackson, Congressman Jefferson, parents, family, friends, faculty, and most importantly the great graduating Class of 2004 – I'm honored to be with you.\nYou've given me more power today as a presidential candidate than I've had in all my years in public office – my speech this afternoon is all that stands between you and your degree.\nWhen I was called by Chancellor Jackson, he told me that the students at Southern wanted a commencement speaker who was in public office, someone who was in amazing physical shape for his age, a man who would mesmerize them with his speaking ability while dazzling everyone with his charm. I told him I was honored and flattered and then he said, \"since you're friends with Arnold Schwarzenegger, see if he's available.\" Well, he wasn't – and now here I am.\nI asked my daughter Vanessa, who is now a medical student, for help with this Commencement address. She said, ‘Dad, you remember college -- up 20 hours a day, grabbing some pizza and a beer whenever you can to keep going, petrified about being called on and not knowing the answer to a question.' I said to her, \"that doesn't sound like college, that sounds like running for President.\"\nDriving here late last night from Baton Rouge, I tried to think of the most important thing I can say to you today. I think there is only one piece of advice that will really affect you over the next 24 hours. Do not forget to call your mom tomorrow on Mother's day. One phone call can save you weeks of guilt and pain!\nI could talk to you today about the world of opportunity you're about to enter. But there's not much I can share that you don't already know. You came to college seeking higher education and wider horizons. And now the great concern is jobs. Twenty five years ago, economists didn't even contemplate many of the jobs you're about to begin, providing we create them. But they were right about one thing: those with a college education would end up on the winning side of the economic divide. Through your hard work, with the help of your families, in all the fields you're entering, you'll be the innovators. You'll push the curve of discovery, so that twenty five years from today, SUNO graduates will be taking their place in an even newer and more advanced workplace that you helped to pioneer building on the lessons you learned right here.\nNearly half a century ago at one of Southern's first commencements, one of your first Presidents, Dr. Felton Clark, made it clear he wanted to prove something to America. He said \"they put us out here on this bluff, not expecting much of anything from us. But we are going to fool them.\"\nSUNO long ago exceeded the expectations of cynics and doubters decade after decade. Since the first graduating class of fifteen donned their caps and gowns in May, 1963 just three months before Dr. Kings ‘I Have a Dream' speech, the Southern University system's distinguished alumni -- like Dean Millie Charles -- have taken their place in the line of leaders to represent America's historically black colleges and universities. We honor the contributions of your own Congressman Bill Jefferson, the first African American from Louisiana to serve in Congress since Reconstruction; Dr. Ruth Simmons, the first African American woman to earn a Ph.D in political science; and Dr. Charles Drew, the physician who pioneered the medical advance of saving blood plasma that in turn saves millions of lives today.\nSo today you have big footsteps to follow in, and much is expected of you because much has been contributed – not just from the more than 150 campuses of our nation's historically black colleges and universities, but from individuals who believed they could make a difference.\nBut the fact is, there's a different kind of challenge today.\nBecause of the day to day focus on just making ends meet, because of a culture that too often puts self over community, too many people have lost sight of a basic truth about America. The fact is, our greatest strength, our greatest responsibility, and our greatest need today, is service and citizenship.\nI know that many of you may be skeptical. I don't blame you. It's hard to find faith and answer the call of citizenship and service when you believe today's call to arms may be tomorrow's broken promise.\nBut America needs your generation to surprise those who underestimate the idealism and commitment of young people in the United States of America.\nJust look around Louisiana and around our country, and you'll see great challenges that should matter to all of us. These are not challenges that can just be left to other people or nobody. Families working longer for less. Middle class parents sometimes working two or three jobs just to pay the mortgage and basic necessities.\nHealth care costs up by 49 percent in the last three years. College tuition rising by as much 28 percent. Working Americans saddled with a new deficit: a deficit of time – time with children, time with our aging parents, time to teach and learn, and really live.\nThe truth is we can help change that – but only if you're willing to get involved. Our democracy is only as good as the people involved in it, and today too many people aren't involved.\nAmerica needs you on the frontlines. We need you to give some of your time and energy to the great cause of reducing illiteracy, preserving our environment, providing after-school care, helping our seniors live in dignity, building new homes for those who need them – and in all of this, building a nation that really is one America.\nThe fact is, this kind of service will not only change every American's heart, it will also change the way America works. More senior citizens will be able to live independently in their own homes instead of nursing homes. Teachers can have the assistance they need so every child knows how to read. We can make the hardest job in the world – being a parent – a little easier by giving moms and dads more support in the uphill struggle to balance work and family.\nAnd through service we can help America live up to the fullest meaning of our values and traditions in the world. My wife Teresa was born in a dictatorship in East Africa. She never saw her father vote, and she first came to know America not as her home, not as a place on the map, but as an idea. It was an idea that drew her and millions of other people to America. Every day she reminds me of the ideals of America through the eyes of a naturalized American. She reminds me how people all over the world should always see our country.\nBut in the last days we've all seen photos of horrific abuses in an Iraqi prison that do a disservice to the courageous efforts of over 100,000 American soldiers in Iraq and our entire military. Those abuses have done enormous damage to our country. They've hurt us in our objectives in Iraq, and empowered those who find fault with America. It requires us to work even harder to present who we really are, and if you choose to, you can help to do that. You can do it here at home and you can do it around the world. The Peace Corps is the most powerful symbol of non-military service in our history. If there was ever a time when everyday people in the most deprived countries, cities and villages of the world need to see idealistic Americans working to help them, it is today, when we are engaged in a struggle to win the hearts and minds of people everywhere. Yet today there are only 6,700 Peace Corps volunteers, far fewer than in the 1960's - when much of the globe was off limits due to the Cold War. We need once again for young Americans to serve in all the places where we can make a difference - from the Middle East to African nations ravaged by AIDS. Living up to the real definition of citizenship matters to the hopes and aspirations of people all over this planet.\nSo I ask you to reject the cynicism that says you can't make a difference. And I ask you to remember the lessons and legacy that proves the cynics dead wrong. We got a Civil Rights Act because people were willing to march. We got clean air and clean water protection because 20 million people joined together on one day to demand it.\nRemember what a 26-year old minister from Montgomery, Alabama did to help ensure that all women and all men are treated equally in this country. Martin Luther King Jr. led us from bus boycotts to the march on Washington and to the mountaintop to begin to change the hearts of a divided nation. But that journey is still unfinished.\nWomen achieved the right to vote not because it was just given to them, but because they fought for it and demanded it.\nRemember the millions of students who were your age and organized to stop the war in Vietnam, and the young veterans who struggled to help a weary nation tired of war keep faith with soldiers who returned home.\nRemember the young firefighters and police officers and EMT's who rushed to Ground Zero on 9/11. They stayed and worked in the rain and in the dark until the last load of debris was carried out.\nRemember the Americans who woke up on September 12th committed to serve their country in the military, many of whom are in harm's way today in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nRemember the every day acts of individuals keeping faith with family and friends. Think of the great gift of your classmate Michael Alexander Smith who today receives his Master of Arts in Criminal Justice. He encouraged his mother to return to school, they relied on each other, and together they received their bachelor's degrees. But that's not the end of the story. He met a young woman whom he also encouraged to come to school here. He married her, adopted her beautiful children, became a family, and they are graduating here today. That's the kind of individual gift that makes a difference to our community and our country. That's how you got here today – through the love of your family and those around you.\nMy parents also taught me about responsibility and service – not with their words, but by how they lived their lives. My mother was a lifelong volunteer in our community and an environmental activist before it was popular. My father was a proud member of the Greatest Generation -- World War II, Army Air Corps.\nDuring the war, while he was off on duty, and my mother was volunteering, my mother sent him a letter. \"You have no idea of the ways in which one can be useful right now,\" she wrote. \"There's something for everyone to do.\"\nHalf a century later, in a very different but equally fateful time, there is work for all to do, a place for all to serve, and no room on the sidelines. America needs you.\nSo promise yourselves, promise your parents, promise the teachers who have mentored and guided you through this university – that somehow you will find a way to serve your country in ways big and small. Don't doubt you can change the world. Only doubt those who say you can't. Remember, Martin Luther King told us: \"Everybody can be great because everybody can serve.\"\nSo go out of here and be great -- Congratulations, graduates -- Good luck and Godspeed.", "timestamp": "2004-05-08", "title": "Commencement Address at Southern University at New Orleans"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29691", "text": "I want to start by thanking all of you who are studying to become nurses here at Edinboro. America needs you. And when the hours get long and the work gets tough, just remember – you will spend your days bringing comfort to the sick and healing to the ill, and there are few callings greater than that.\nA nurse has one of the most difficult jobs in the world. On an average day a nurse has put up with a stubborn bureaucracy, inefficiency in the system and an uncaring administration...sounds a lot like Washington!\nYou are about to join a profession that delivers the best care in the world.\nBut you are about to join at a time when the cost of receiving that care has never been more expensive for the hardworking families who need it.\nWell I'm here to tell you we can do something about that. Our health care system is badly broken. And I have a health care plan that covers nearly 95% of all Americans. But today, I want to focus on the part of my plan that deals with the most serious part of the health care crisis – costs. It's a plan that will cut soaring premiums, cut the waste, cut the greed, and cut Americans a break. And it's a plan that finally makes our health care affordable, our businesses more competitive, and America stronger.\nToday, regular check-ups are emptying family checkbooks. Waiting for a doctor's bill is causing as much anxiety as waiting for a diagnosis. And cutting through endless red tape and paperwork is wasting millions that could be spent on better care.\nHere in the Erie area, you're seeing plants close down that provided good jobs and quality health care to their employees for years. A lot of these jobs have moved overseas, where the cost of health care isn't nearly as high. And for the companies that stay, the price of health care is rising too fast for folks to afford.\nI just met with Albert Barker. Albert is sixty-one years old, and he used to work at Custom Engineering right over in Erie. A little while back, Albert had a heart attack. After he recovered and returned to work, Albert's employer told him he couldn't afford to provide insurance anymore. They re-hired him as a temporary worker, and Albert was then forced to pay $290 a month for temporary coverage. Just this month, that coverage ran out.\nHis wife Roseanne said \"I never dreamed things could be like this. Al's worked his entire life. Now we just pray every day that nothing goes wrong.\"\nNo one should have to live in fear that they are one doctor's visit away from financial ruin. And when I am President, no one will.\nSince I began this journey over a year ago, I have met too many people like the Barkers. Hardworking families struggling under the weight of their medical bills. Business owners who aren't hiring because they can't afford to cover more employees. Veterans whose co-payments are putting health care out of reach.\nI remember Virginia Noble. Virginia has cut every cost and saved every penny, but she still cannot afford to insure the eleven employees who work in her Des Moines sandwich shop. She wonders how long her small shop can stay competitive, but more importantly, she worries about the health of the eleven people who've helped make it a success. Small business owners like Virginia create the jobs that make America strong, and I'll be a President who does everything I can to make that job easier.\nI remember Myrtle Walck. During a town hall in Iowa, she told us how every month, she has to sign her $400 Social Security check over to her local drugstore just to cover the cost of two daily prescriptions. At 82 years old, she's losing her only source of income to two bottles of pills. Myrtle still gives her best to her country by teaching kids how to read at a local school each week. Is this the best her country can give to her?\nThis is not acceptable in America.\nIt's not acceptable to do nothing about total family premiums rising more than $2700 in just four years\nIt's not acceptable to do nothing while these premiums are rising four times faster than workers' earnings.\nAnd it's not acceptable to do nothing while families lose their savings, workers lose their jobs, and businesses close their doors because of the high cost of health care.\nWe need a President who knows our health care crisis isn't acceptable and who has a plan to fix it. And that's the kind of President I will be.\nFor anyone who thinks this is acceptable, another four years of this Administration is just what the doctor ordered. For four years, they haven't made a dent in the cost of health care. For four years, they haven't even tried. They've stood by while insurance companies made record profits and families faced record-high premiums. And while he's campaigning across the country, you almost never hear the words \"health care\" come out of the President's mouth.\nThrough their words and their actions, the Bush Administration has showed that they do not consider the high cost of health care a serious problem. I do. I still see the faces. I still remember their stories. And I have a plan to do something about it.\nNow, since my wife has begged me not to bore you with the details of the plan, I'm going to ask all of you to visit www.johnkerry.com to find out exactly how we're going to get this done. But since I also have a reputation to uphold, I'm going to talk a little bit about it today, too.\nHere's what I will do to control rising health care costs:\nFirst, we're going to cut your family's premiums by up to $1000. That's $1000 in real savings you can use to buy groceries, pay the bills, and save for your future. And that will mean more jobs and more competitive American businesses.\nSecond, we're going to make sure that government bureaucrats aren't messing with your health care. We're going to save money by cutting waste from the health care system – not adding it. The cost of health care today is $1.4 trillion. It would be one thing if all those dollars were being spent making Americans healthier. They're not.\nOur system simply has too much waste and too much fraud; there's too much inefficiency and too much abuse, too much bureaucracy and too much greed. Doctors are drowning in paperwork instead of seeing patients. Families are sitting in emergency rooms wading through forms instead of being by the side of their loved ones. And industry insiders are cutting corners and making deals that all of us end up paying for. This is wrong, and when I am President, it will end.\nToday, each time you make a health care transaction, it costs up to $25. The same transactions in other industries, like a bank, cost less than a penny because of better technology. As President, I'll bring better technology to our health care system, cutting costs for families and reducing the medical errors that cost lives.\nAnd we'll do a better job of holding down medical malpractice costs. No one should ever prevent patients who have been harmed from seeking justice. But we need a national system in place that will weed out the irresponsible lawsuits without taking away patient's rights. Lawsuits that have no basis in facts have no place in our courts. And when I'm President, they'll be gone.\nThird, it's time to cut rising prescription drug costs. When I'm President., we'll close loopholes that stop more affordable prescriptions from making it to your pharmacy. We'll allow you to buy prescription drugs from Canada safely so you can get the same discounts that are available across the border. And we'll negotiate a better price for prescription drugs. That's a good deal for seniors and a good deal for taxpayers.\nWith these reforms, we will make real savings in the cost of health care. More importantly, we'll save lives, we'll save jobs, we'll save paychecks, and we'll save businesses. American companies will have an easier time competing around the world, and American small businesses will have more money to grow and create new jobs. We'll build healthier households, more prosperous communities, and a stronger America.\nFor me, health care is an issue that hits very close to home. In the last two years, I've seen the health care system up close, the good and the bad. I've lost both my parents. And just one year ago, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Today, I'm blessed to stand before you 100% cured. I was lucky to have some of the best care in the world. And I believe that high quality health care should be affordable to every American.\nI've seen the faces of America's health care crisis. I've heard their stories. And those faces and those stories are what I will take with me everyday of this campaign. And if I am President, they are what I will take with me every day to the Oval Office as I fight to lower health care costs for all Americans. I will finally complete the mission begun by Harry Truman, and I will make sure that at long last, affordable health care is a right, and not a privilege, for every American.", "timestamp": "2004-05-10", "title": "Remarks at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania"}

Together we're going to end the Bush Presidency – and if you continue to work as hard as you are to make that happen, I will work every day for your jobs – your families – your healthcare – your rights – and we'll put Jobs First in America again.\nIt's great to be here in Las Vegas. This place is the complete opposite of Washington. In Vegas people gamble with their own money.\nMany of you have served in the Armed Forces, and many are now in the Guard and reserves doing their duty today. Not a moment or day goes by that we don't think about our troops. They're our sons and daughters – our neighbors and they are in harm's way to serve the nation and principles we love. Today and everyday we say God bless them and we thank them for their courage. We thank them for their service. We support them beyond words.\nI also want to congratulate all of you. Not only do you do the work that builds America – You're doing the hard work of knocking on doors – walking house to house – talking to neighbors and fellow workers. You're building a stronger America by helping working people get ahead in our economy.\nAnd that's the most important work in America today.\nAll around us people are struggling.\nToday, in America, there is a couple in Erie, Pennsylvania wondering how they'll pay $150,000 in medical bills. The husband survived a heart attack and triple bypass surgery only to find out that he lost every dime of health insurance because his employer couldn't afford it anymore. We need to keep working for him.\nToday, in America, there is a woman in Dayton, Ohio wondering what she did to deserve her pink slip. She walked into work one day and found out that they were outsourcing her job to China, unbolting the equipment and sending that overseas too. We need to keep working for her.\nToday, in America, right in Reno, there are 280 of your Teamster brothers and sisters who are risking their jobs to fight for affordable health care and an extra 90 cents an hour. Truck drivers wondering why they get up and work hard every day and still can't pay the bills. We need to keep working, keep fighting, and keep standing strong with them.\nFor almost four years, they've been asking this White House, \"What are you going to do about this? What's your plan to solve the problems facing our daily lives?\" And for four years, they've basically told us: \"You're on your own.\"\nThey don't have a plan. I do.\nThis Administration has stubbornly refused to admit a single mistake and stubbornly turned away the chances they've had to fix them. Now, they're running on the promise that they'll keep doing more of the same.\nThis is like the Red Sox saying, \"Let's see if we can go another 86 years without a World Series.\"\nTheir way hasn't made America stronger. My way will.\nWe know we can do better and think bigger about the challenges we face.\nWe know that a strong economy is a growing middle-class where every American has a chance to work and an opportunity to succeed.\nAnd Teamsters know better than anyone that America is at its best when Americans are at work.\nSo let me tell you what I'm going to do:\nI'm going to put America back to work with a plan to create good paying jobs. My strategy is built on a simple principle: We should reward work, make sure Americans have a chance to work, and get ahead when they do.\nWe can cut taxes for businesses that do right by America and reward companies for creating jobs here instead of for moving jobs overseas. If a company is torn between creating jobs here or overseas, we now have a tax code that tells you to go overseas. That's wrong. And if I am President, it will end.\nThis is just basic common sense. And we need to apply the same kind of fairness when it comes to enforcing our trade agreements.\nWe need to trade. We always have. When we engage with the world on a level playing field, no country prospers more than ours.\nBut we'll never get ahead if other countries aren't living up to their part of the bargain. This Administration hasn't enforced our trade deals – I will. I will because I know that when other countries walk all over our agreements our companies and our workers can't compete. It's not right that we have a $500 billion trade deficit. I'm going to fight to give the American worker a level playing field, because when we do there's not a country in the world the American worker can't compete with and win.\nThis is not a philosophical question about free trade or protectionism; it is just a common sense question – why aren't we enforcing our own laws on behalf of our own workers and businesses.\nWhen I am president, we will never turn a blind eye to clear trade violations when American jobs are on the line.\nWhen we enter an agreement, those countries will know that they must live up to their part of the bargain.\nWe will fight to make sure all new trade agreements will include enforceable labor and environmental provisions in the core of the agreement. And we will renegotiate CAFTA to make sure they're included there too.\nAnd we will make American businesses more competitive by reducing one of their biggest costs: health care.\nOver the last three years, premiums have soared by $2,700. It's costing families their life savings and it's costing businesses new jobs. My plan would cut costs, cut waste, cut greed, and cut health care premiums by up to $1,000 for a family.\nBut we need to do even more for middle-class Americans who are working harder, earning less, and paying more for health care and college and taxes. That's why under my plan, 98% of Americans and 99% of American businesses will get a tax cut.\nLet me be clear: when I'm President, your taxes will go down so your incomes will go up.\nFinally, the only way we will create new jobs that will create new opportunities is to invest in them. Manufacturing jobs that will, once again, be the backbone of the American economy.\nToday, businesses are harnessing new technology to manufacture energy-efficient cars, high-grade steel, advanced plastics and other new products. And they require a bigger, higher-skilled labor force to fill those jobs. To make sure those are American workers in American businesses, we need to make sure we're providing the job training and the start-up capital to make it happen. And when I'm President, we will.\nBack when your union began, it was horse-drawn wagons that connected people who traded with the products they needed. Those first Teamsters knew something that has kept this Brotherhood strong for years: that we are stronger when we work together.\nToday, America is still being built by everyday men and women who work hard and do what's right. They raise their kids, help their neighbors, and love their country. They don't ask for special favors – all they want is a chance to get ahead.\nThey deserve a President who will offer action not just words.\nThey deserve a President whose actions will reflect the truth that all those firefighters, police officers, rescue workers who ran up those stairs at the World Trade Center on September 11th so others could live – every one of them was a member of organized labor – and they believed in the right to strike, the right to bargain, and the right to organize.\nTeamsters –  They all believed that we are stronger when we work together. When we protect the right to organize for our workers. When we fight for fair wages, affordable health care, and the chance for a better education. When we create good jobs for every American who wants one. And when we spread opportunity to every American who hopes for it.\nThis is the America I want to lead. This is the America I know we can have. And this is the America I ask you to join me in building. Let's get it done. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2004-05-16", "title": "Remarks to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Annual Unity Conference in Las Vegas"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29693", "text": "Thank you for that generous introduction. And thank you for the invitation to join you in honoring the legacy and renewing the hopes of a Supreme Court decision that forever changed our country and our lives. On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court of the United States declared that separate would never be equal, setting forth a vision of equality that continues to inspire freedom lovers and freedom movements here in America and around the globe. And it started here in Topeka.\nBut that is no surprise. Topeka has always been a place for making history. Two hundred years ago, Lewis and Clark mapped the sight of this city in their journey across the continent. A hundred and fifty years ago, Topeka became the free-state capital battling against pro-slavery LeCompton. And fifty years ago this very day, the next great battle for freedom was centered here in Topeka's segregated schools.\nBrown summoned our country to make real the ideal of one nation and one people. A nation where one day all of God's children would live in the light of equality. A nation where, as Dr. King said later, we would be able to \"transform ... into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.\" Those of us who have embraced this vision redeemed the promise of America and make our country stronger.\nIt's hard to believe it's been fifty years since Brown. Fifty years since the color of your skin determined where you could get a drink of water. Where you could sit on the bus. Whether you had a seat at the lunch counter. And where you could go to school.\nIn 1954, in Topeka, there were 18 neighborhood schools for white children and just four \"black only\" elementary schools. Oliver Brown thought it was wrong that his seven-year-old daughter, Linda and her friends had to walk a mile through a railroad yard every day just to catch a bus to their segregated elementary school. The trip took more than an hour, and on the way, Linda walked right past the closed doors of a white elementary school just 3 blocks from her house. It was separate -- but it was not equal. The Supreme Court agreed and that decision became a turning point in America's long march toward equality.\nAlthough the journey here isn't finished, Topeka, has been transformed these fifty years. We are joined here today by Topeka's first African American Mayor, James McClinton. And isn't it a measure of the progress we've made that Topeka has a school superintendent who 50 years ago couldn't have walked the halls of many schools in this city? Today, Tony Sawyer is not only walking the halls, he is commanding the corridors of power of the Topeka school system.\nAll of America is a better place because of Brown. Back then, only four percent of African Americans had college degrees. Today, nearly twenty percent are college graduates. But we have more to do.\nIn the 1950s, there were less than 200 black elected officials in all of America, and even fewer Hispanic Americans. Now there are more than 14,000 -- including the 59 members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Hispanic Caucus. But we have more to do.\nThere were no African Americans on the big corporate boards back then. Today, more than forty percent of the Fortune 1000 companies have black directors, and nearly fifteen percent have Latino directors. But we have more to do.\nAnd while it wasn't until six years before Brown that President Truman integrated our military, I can tell you from first-hand experience that service to our country – loyalty to mission and to brother and sister soldiers on the battlefield – knows no color line. Whether we hail from the foothills of Appalachia ... the street corners of Topeka ... the neighborhoods of Flushing ... the barrios of East LA or the reservations of Arizona ... whether we are new immigrants or our descendents came here on the Mayflower or were brought here on a slave ship in shackles ... when we fight side by side in places like Vietnam and Iraq and Afghanistan, we're all Americans sacrificing for the same country and praying to the same God.\nToday, more than ever, we need to renew our commitment to one America. We should not delude ourselves into thinking that the work of Brown is done when there are those who still seek, in different ways, to see it undone. To rollback affirmative action – to restrict equal rights – to undermine the promise of our Constitution.\nYes, we have to defend the progress that has been made. But we also have to move the cause forward. Brown began to tear down the walls of inequality. The next great challenge is to put up a ladder of opportunity for all.\nBecause as far as we've come, we still have not met the promise of Brown.\nWe have not met the promise of Brown when one-third of all African-American children are living in poverty.\nWe have not met the promise of Brown when only fifty percent of African-American men in New York City have a job.\nWe have not met the promise of Brown when nearly twenty million black and Hispanic Americans don't have basic health insurance.\nAnd we have certainly have not met the promise of Brown when, in too many parts of our country, our school systems are not separate but equal – but they are separate and unequal.\nWe haven't met the promise of Brown when a fourth-grade Hispanic child is only one third as likely to read at the same level as a fourth grade white child. When only fifty percent of African-Americans are finishing high school, and only 18 percent are graduating college. Our children will never have equal opportunity unless, once and for all, we close the ever-widening achievement gap. We know the answer is both higher expectations and greater resources. You cannot promise no child left behind and then pursue policies that leave millions of children behind. Because that promise is a promissory note to all of America's families that must be paid in full.\nWe cannot be content to see nearly four million students in this nation going to schools that are literally crumbling around them. We cannot be content to see those who teach the next generation treated like second-rate employees -- not like the professionals they are. We all know from our own lives that good teachers can make all the difference. Yet, today, where the best teachers are needed the most, they're too often paid the least.\nSo how do we honor the legacy of Brown? That question was answered some 20 years before that decision by a son of Lawrence, Kansas and one of America's greatest poets – Langston Hughes. In one of his most soul wrenching poems, Hughes challenged the nation to \"Let America Be America Again.\" He called that generation to fulfill the unmet promise of America:\nO' let my land be a land where liberty\nIs crowned with no false patriotic wreath\nBut opportunity is real, and life is free,\nEquality is in the air we breathe.\nAnd so we honor the legacy of Brown by letting America be America – by reaffirming the value of inclusion, equality, and diversity in our schools and across the life of our nation. By opening the doors of opportunity, so that more of our young people can stay in school and out of prison. By lifting more of our people out of poverty, expanding the middle class, providing health care, and bringing jobs, hope and opportunity to all the neighborhoods of the forgotten America.\nWe must let America be America again. We must work together to turn back the creeping tide of division that Thurgood Marshall and so many others fought so hard against.\nWe must never forget that the Brown decision came in the wake of World War II, when African-American soldiers helped to save freedom in the world, only to return to brutal inequality at home. They did not ask for special treatment or extra help; they just wanted the fullness of freedom in their own lives. They wanted to see the end of the \"white only\" signs at the restaurants and movie theaters, at school house doors and department stores– and they wanted to see an end to the invisible, but all too real \"white only\" sign that reached from Congress into every great corporation and into businesses in small towns.\nAnd when I joined so many other veterans of Vietnam for a return without welcome to America I saw first hand how those on the front lines of combat, black and brown, who had been casualties in greater numbers than the representation of our population, were shunned even after service. Their unemployment numbers were higher. Their opportunities were less than those with whom they had served and the ravages of post-war trauma fell even more heavily on their families and their lives.\nThe memory of all of these patriots and the decision we commemorate today calls us again to the America we must become. Our brave men and women who are on frontlines far away deserve no less. For them and for our country, fifty years after Brown we have only just begun. For America to be America for any of us, America must be America for all of us.\nThank you and God bless you.", "timestamp": "2004-05-17", "title": "Remarks on the Anniversary of Brown v.

{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29694", "text": "Good morning, this is John Kerry.\nMany of you are listening to this address while riding in your car. Some of you might be on your way to pick up your son or daughter from Little League. Others might be driving to the grocery store. You might be stuck in traffic on your way to the mall. And for many, you're pulling out of the gas station after filling up the tank.\nHow much did it cost you and your family this week? $30 or $40? Too many Americans filled up their cars and trucks this week and saw that for the first time the average price of a gallon of gas has climbed above $2.00. With Memorial Day weekend a few days away and nearly 30 million Americans expected to travel in their cars, families have to find more and more extra money in their budgets to pay for gas.\nThere are two reasons why we cannot be asleep at the wheel during this current energy crisis. First soaring energy prices are putting our economy at risk and second, our dependence on Middle East oil is putting our national security at risk.\nBut it doesn't have to be this way.\nIn the short-term, we can lower energy costs, help working families, and provide relief to our farmers who will spend an additional $1.3 billion on gas this year; to our truck drivers who will spend an additional $6 billion; and provide relief to our airlines that will spend an additional $7 billion on jet fuel. And in the long-term, we can have an energy plan that makes America independent of Middle East oil and strengthens our national security.\nWe can live in an America that is energy independent. We can live in an America that runs on the cars of the future that we only have to fill up once a month, not every week. We can live in an America that invests in new technology that will make us energy independent and provide good paying jobs for every American.\nWe can do this with a president who leads. America's can-do spirit invented the cars we drive and built the roads and bridges we use every day. Our imagination and sense of discovery took us to the moon. And our determination and perseverance helped us conquer diseases like polio.\nWhen America sees a problem or a great possibility, it is in our collective character to set our sights on the horizon and not stop working until we get there. That's what America does best – and now we need to let America be America again so we can meet this energy challenge. Our dependence on foreign oil is a problem we must solve together the only way we can: by inventing our way out of it.\nFor decades, we have been stuck on a never-ending energy crisis rollercoaster. Gas prices rise and people talk about the need for a new energy policy. When gas prices drop, people drop the issue. If unrest erupts in the Middle East, people talk about the need to be independent of foreign oil. When prices drop and stability returns, we turn to another topic. It is time to get off this ride and chart a new course to energy independence.\nBut in the short-term, we have to help our families and business with these high energy costs. First, we should go to the Saudi government and other OPEC nations and demand that they increase supply. And second, we should divert oil that's being used to fill our reserves and bring it to the market to bring down prices. But short-term steps are just stopgaps unless we have a long-term plan.\nI have a plan to invest in new technologies and alternative fuels to make America energy independent of Middle East oil. As president, I will establish tax credits that help consumers buy and manufacturers build fuel efficient cars. America is America when we lead the world to new inventions and technologies. And I believe America can and should be the place that builds the cars and creates the jobs of the future.\nA strong America begins at home – with energy independence from the Middle East. Let's ensure that no young American soldier has to fight and die because of our dependence on foreign oil. This is the great project for our generation.\nNext week is Memorial Day weekend – a time to honor Americans who served their country and a time to spend with our families. This year is going to be different.\nWe're at war and families are struggling to make ends meet, especially with rising gas prices. For our security, our economy, and our environment, we must make America energy independent. Together, let's do it.\nI'm John Kerry.

{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29695", "text": "Thank you all for being here.\nOver the next ten days, our nation will come together to honor the bravery and sacrifice of past generations of Americans. On Saturday, in our nation's capital, we will dedicate a memorial to the heroes of the Greatest Generation who won World War II. On Memorial Day, we will salute all those who for more than two centuries made the ultimate sacrifice when America's freedom was on the line.\nAnd on June 6th, we will mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day by remembering the brave young men who scaled the cliffs on beaches called Omaha and Utah – and brought the light of liberty from the New World to the Old.\nTo me, and to millions of Americans, the days ahead will be filled with the pride of families, the sadness of loss and a renewed commitment to service. But that is not enough. We must pay tribute.\nWe must hear and heed the lessons of the Greatest Generation.\nOur leaders then understood that America drew its power not only from the might of weapons, but also from the trust and respect of nations around the globe. There was a time, not so long ago, when the might of our alliances was a driving force in the survival and success of freedom – in two World Wars, in the long years of the Cold War – then from the Gulf War to Bosnia and Kosovo. America led instead of going it alone. We extended a hand, not a fist. We respected the world – and the world respected us.\nMore than a century ago, Teddy Roosevelt defined American leadership in foreign policy. He said America should walk softly and carry a big stick. Time and again, this Administration has violated the fundamental tenet of Roosevelt's approach, as he described it: \"If a man continually blusters, if he lacks civility, a big stick will not save him from trouble.\"\nBut that is precisely what this Administration has done. They looked to force before exhausting diplomacy. They bullied when they should have persuaded.\nThey have gone it alone when they should have assembled a team. They have hoped for the best when they should have prepared for the worst. In short, they have undermined the legacy of generations of American leadership. And that is what we must restore.\nToday, there is still a powerful yearning around the world for an America that listens and leads again. An America that is respected, and not just feared.\nI believe that respect is an indispensable mark of our nation's character – and an indispensable source of our nation's strength. It is the indispensable bond of America's mighty alliances.\nI'm running for president because, abroad as well as at home, it's time to let America be America again. By doing so, we can restore our place in the world and make America safer.\nIt's time for a new national security policy guided by four new imperatives: First, we must launch and lead a new era of alliances for the post 9-11 world. Second, we must modernize the world's most powerful military to meet the new threats. Third, in addition to our military might, we must deploy all that is in America's arsenal -- our diplomacy, our intelligence system, our economic power, and the appeal of our values and ideas. Fourth and finally, to secure our full independence and freedom, we must free America from its dangerous dependence on Mideast oil.\nThese four imperatives are a response to an inescapable reality: War has changed; the enemy is different – and we must think and act anew.\nToday, we are waging a global war against a terrorist movement committed to our destruction. Terrorists like al Qaeda and its copycat killers are unlike any adversary our nation has faced. We do not know for certain how they are organized or how many operatives they have. But we know the destruction they can inflict.\nWe saw it in New York and in Washington; we have seen it in Bali and in Madrid, in Israel and across the Middle East; and we see it day after day in Iraq.\nThis threat will only be magnified as the technology to build nuclear and biological weapons continues to spread. And we can only imagine what would happen if the deadly forces of terrorism got their hands on the deadliest weapons in history.\nEveryone outside the Administration seems to understand that we are in deep trouble in Iraq. Failure there would be a terrible setback. It would be a boon to our enemies, and jeopardize the long-term prospects for a peaceful, democratic Middle East – leaving us at war not just with a small, radical minority, but with increasingly large portions of the entire Muslim world.\nThere is also the continuing instability in Afghanistan, where al Qaeda still has a base, and Osama bin Laden is still at large, because the Bush Administration didn't finish him off at the battle of Tora Bora. And in East Asia, North Korea poses a genuine nuclear threat, while we have begun to strip American troops to relieve the overburdened forces in Iraq.\nIn the coming week, I will also offer specific plans to build a new military capable of defeating enemies new and old, and to stop the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. But first, here today, I want to set out the overall architecture of a new policy to make America stronger and respected in the world.\nThe first new imperative represents a return to the principle that guided us in peril and victory through the past century – alliances matter, and the United States must lead them.\nNever has this been more true than in the war on terrorism.\nAs president, my number one security goal will be to prevent the terrorists from gaining weapons of mass murder. And our overriding mission will be to disrupt and destroy their terrorist cells.\nBecause al Qaeda is a network with many branches, we must take the fight to the enemy on every continent – and enlist other countries in that cause.\nAmerica must always be the world's paramount military power. But we can magnify our power through alliances. We simply can't go it alone – or rely on a coalition of the few. The threat of terrorism demands alliances on a global scale – to find the extremist groups, to guard ports and stadiums, to share intelligence, and to get the terrorists before they get us. In short, we need a \"coalition of the able\" – and in truth, no force on earth is more able than the United States and its allies.\nWe must build that force – and we can. We can be strong without being stubborn. Indeed, that is ultimately the only way we can succeed.\nBuilding strong alliances is only the first step. We cannot meet the new threats unless our military is adapted for new missions. This is my second new imperative.\nAs president, on my first day in office, I will send a message to every man and woman in our armed forces: This commander-in-chief will ensure that you are the best-led, best-equipped and most respected fighting force in the world. You will be armed with the right weapons, schooled in the right skills, and fully prepared to win on the battlefield. But you will never be sent into harm's way without enough troops for the task, or asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace.\nAnd you will never be given assignments which have not been clearly defined and for which you are not professionally trained.\nThis Administration has disregarded the advice, wisdom, and experience of our professional military officers. And often ended the careers of those who dared to give their honest assessments. That is not the way to make the most solemn decisions of war and peace. As president, I will listen to and respect the views of our experienced military leaders – and never let ideology trump the truth.\nIn the past, when our leaders envisioned the use of force, they had in mind the unleashing of massive numbers of American troops, battleships and aircraft in confrontation with the uniformed military of an enemy nation. Of course, a conventional war to halt conventional aggression still remains a possibility for which we must prepare. But there are other urgent challenges.\nI will modernize our military to match its new missions. We must get the most out of new technologies. We must reform training and update the way we structure our armed forces -- for example, with special forces designed to strike terrorists in their sanctuaries, and with national guard and reserve units retooled to meet the requirements of homeland defense.\nThis strategy focuses not only on what we must do, but on what we must prevent. We must ensure that lawless states and terrorists will not be armed with weapons of mass destruction.\nThis is the single gravest threat to our security. Any potential adversary should know that we will defend ourselves against the possibility of attack by unconventional arms. If such a strike does occur, as commander-in-chief, I will respond with overwhelming and devastating force. If such an attack appears imminent, as commander-in-chief, I will do whatever is necessary to stop it. And, as commander-in-chief, I will never cede our security to anyone. I will always do what is necessary to safeguard our country.\nThe Justice Department said yesterday that terrorists may be planning to attack the United States again this summer -- some believe that al Qaeda would use an attack to try and influence the outcome of the November election.\nI have a message today for al Qaeda or any terrorist who may be harboring these illusions: We may have an election in here in America. But let there be no doubt -- this country is united in its determination to destroy you. And let me be absolutely clear: As commander-in-chief, I will bring the full force of our nation's power to bear on finding and crushing your networks. We will use every available resource to destroy you.\nBut not all problems should be viewed through a military lens. We should never wait to act until we have no other choice but war. That brings me to my third new imperative.\nIn this new world, beyond military power, we must deploy all the power in America's arsenal.\nWe need to employ a layered defense to keep the worst weapons from falling into the worst hands. A strategy that invokes our non-military strength early enough and effectively enough so military force doesn't become our only option.\nAs President, I will launch a global initiative to fully secure the materials needed for nuclear weapons that already exist and sharply limit and control future production.\nThis initiative will include changes in international treaties, sharing of intelligence, and setting conditions for economic sanctions and the interdiction of illegal shipments. The key is for America to lead: to build an international consensus for early preventive action, so that states don't even think of taking the nuclear road, and potential traffickers in nuclear and biological technology fear the consequences of getting caught.\nWe must also have the best possible intelligence capabilities. Nothing is more important than early warning and specific information when dangerous technologies are being developed or sold. Whether it was September 11th or Iraq's supposed weapons of mass destruction, we have endured too many intelligence failures. That is why I will do what this President has failed to do: reform our intelligence system by making the next director of the CIA a true director of national intelligence, with true control over intelligence personnel and budgets all across the government.\nAll the levers of power will be deployed to overcome the 21st century dangers we face. I intend to discuss this initiative in detail early next week.\nFinally, a new national security policy demands an end to our dependence on Mideast oil. That is my fourth new imperative. For too long, America has lost its voice when talking about the policies and practices of some governments in the Persian Gulf.\nWe have been constrained by their control over the oil that fuels too large a part of our economy. This is a weakness that this Administration has ignored – and one that must be addressed.\nI have proposed a plan for energy independence from Mideast oil in the next ten years. It invests in new technologies and alternative fuels. It provides tax credits to help consumers buy and manufacturers build fuel efficiency cars. It will tap America's initiative and ingenuity to strengthen our national security, grow our economy, and protect our environment.\nIf we are serious about energy independence, then we can finally be serious about confronting the role of Saudi Arabia in financing and providing ideological support of al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. We cannot continue this Administration's kid-glove approach to the supply and laundering of terrorist money. As President, I will impose tough financial sanctions against nations or banks that engage in money laundering or fail to act against it. I will launch a \"name and shame\" campaign against those that are financing terror. And if they do not respond, they will be shut out of the U.S. financial system.\nThe same goes for Saudi sponsorship of clerics who promote the ideology of Islamic terror. To put it simply, we will not do business as usual with Saudi Arabia. They must take concrete steps to stop their clerics from fueling the fires of Islamic extremism.\nLet me now turn to a subject that I know is on the minds of all Americans – the situation in Iraq.\nThe stakes in Iraq couldn't be higher. Earlier this week, the President again said he wanted to create stability and establish a representative government in Iraq. He did acknowledge what many have known all along – that we would be far better off if our allies were with us. What's important now is to turn these words into action.\nIn the coming weeks, President Bush will travel to Europe and meet with the members of the G-8 here in the United States. There will be speeches, handshakes and ceremonies. But will our allies promise to send more troops to Iraq? Will they dedicate substantially more funding for reconstruction there? Will they pledge a real effort to aid the transformation of the Middle East. That is what we need. But the day is late and the situation in Iraq is grim.\nAttracting international support in a situation like Iraq is a clear test of presidential leadership. It is what capable and confident presidents do. I urge President Bush to make a sustained effort. He should start at the Summit in Istanbul by persuading NATO to accept Iraq as an alliance mission, with more troops from NATO and its partners. He should seek help in expanding international support for training Iraq's own security forces, so they can safeguard the rights and well-being of their own people.\nAnd he should propose the creation of an International High Commissioner to work with Iraqis in organizing elections, drafting a constitution, and coordinating reconstruction.\nOver the last year, we've heard from the President that our policy should simply be to stay the course. But one thing I learned in the Navy is that when the course you're on is headed for the shoals, you have to change course.\nIf President Bush doesn't secure new support from our allies, we will, once again, feel the consequences of a foreign policy that has divided the world instead of uniting it. Our troops will be in greater peril, the mission in Iraq will be harder to accomplish, and our country will be less secure.\nI have spoken today about the architecture of a new national security policy. But at issue here is not just a set of prescriptions; at stake is a vision of an America truly stronger and truly respected in the world. This is not a partisan cause. Patriotism doesn't belong to any one Party or President. And if I am President, I will enlist the best among us, regardless of party, to protect the security of this nation.\nAnd I will call on the whole nation to let America be America again.\nMy father was a pilot during World War II. A year before Pearl Harbor, he was on active duty and he later served in the South Pacific.\nAnd for the rest his life, he served in one capacity or another – whether nationally or locally, by vocation or as a volunteer.\nHe told me shortly before he died that the \"human conscience, when it works is the most divine thing in our small segment of the universe.\"\nIn today's world, conscience marks the difference between tolerance and terror.\nIn an earlier era, it was the difference between honor and holocaust.\nMuch has been written about the Greatest Generation.\nThe question before us now is what will be said about our own.\nBecause, for better or worse, as Abraham Lincoln once said, we cannot escape the judgment of history.\nWe do not have to live in fear or stand alone. We don't have to be a lonely \"watchman on the walls of freedom.\" We can, once again, lead a great alliance. That is how we can honor the legacy of the Greatest Generation and restore respect to the greatest country – the United States of America.\nThank you and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-05-27", "title": "\"Security and Strength for a New World\": Remarks of John Kerry"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29696", "text": "Good morning, this is John Kerry.\nSixty-three years ago, Americans gathered around their radios to hear a voice call them to greatness.\nIn a fireside chat just days after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Roosevelt told the nation: \"Together with other free peoples, we are now fighting to maintain our right to live among our world neighbors in freedom, in common decency, without fear of assault.\"\nLater today, when the World War II memorial is dedicated, we will pay tribute to the 16 million American men and women who answered that call and fought for our freedom - and the world's.\nWhen I watch the ceremony, the memory of one man in particular, my father, will make my heart swell with pride. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps a year before Pearl Harbor. He was in the service when I was born in Fitzsimmons Army Hospital in Colorado.\nAnd for the rest his life, he served -- nationally and locally, by vocation and as a volunteer.\nHe told me shortly before he died that the \"human conscience, when it works, is the most divine thing in our small segment of the universe.\"\nIn my father's time, conscience was the difference between honor and holocaust.\nThe difference is why we remember the Greatest Generation in an imperishable way. Because of them, liberty did not perish from this Earth. When the future hung in the balance, they stood on the edge of tyranny and devastation and risked their lives for a history and a hope bigger than themselves.\nIn America, we're blessed. This Memorial Day, when you stop and think about what it takes for our men and women in uniform to risk their lives, say good-bye to their families, and go to frontlines half a world away - it is a profound gesture of honor.\nIt symbolizes the spirit of America - that there are citizen soldiers ready to do what it takes to live and lead by our values. I met so many of them when I fought in Vietnam and I have met them since from Desert Storm, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraqi Freedom. The love of country and sense of duty I have seen and known is special. You carry it with you always. And it's because of those who fought before and those who fight today that it's time do what it takes to build an America that's once again respected in the world.\nIt's time to ensure that our men and women in uniform are the best-equipped fighting force in the world.\nAnd some of the best armor we could ever give our troops will be allies to fight by their side. America has always drawn its power not only from the might of its weapons, but from the trust and respect of nations around the globe. From the World Wars to the Cold War and beyond, American-led alliances have been a driving force in the survival of freedom.\nToday, the new threat of terrorism demands these alliances on a global scale - to share intelligence, to get the terrorists before they get us, and to stop the world's deadliest weapons from falling into the world's most dangerous hands. We must rebuild alliances that have been shredded - because an America respected in the world will be an America stronger in the world - and safer here at home.\nWe are facing an enemy that will stop at nothing. It's time to put away pride and stubbornness. It's time to answer the call to greatness and lead the world. It's time to let America be America again.\nMy father would have prized this day. And he'd be proud to see who I have the honor of being with at the dedication. I met Joe Lesniewski along the campaign trail in Pennsylvania. He's one of eighteen living paratroopers from the Easy Company of the 101st Airborne Division - one of the Band of Brothers who on D-Day parachuted into the enemy territory behind the Normandy beachhead.\nIt's Joe's courage that this memorial celebrates, the courage of almost 400,000 of his fellow soldiers who did not return home, and of the 16 million Americans who will forever be the Greatest Generation. The World War II Memorial is not just monument and stone; it is a medal for all who served and sacrificed.\nSo today, we learn, we are inspired, and we ask: What will be said of our generation? In our time of peril, will we meet the test?\nThat requires us never to forget our values and never to neglect our veterans. It calls on us now, as it once called on Joe, to do all that we must to defend our country. And it calls on us, as it has every President, from Franklin Roosevelt on, not to go it alone, but to build and lead a global alliance for freedom and against fear.\nWe honor the legacy of the greatest generation by making respect for our country and the world the great legacy of our generation. We can let America be America again.\nThanks for listening.", "timestamp": "2004-05-29", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29697", "text": "Thank you and thank you all for being here.\nThis weekend, thousands of men and women and children lined the streets in Florida to watch the Memorial Day Parades. They waved flags. Sons and daughters sat on their fathers' shoulders and cheered as high school marching bands and bands of brothers – and sisters – marched passed them with their heads held high.\nIt is a great time in America – a common scene to honor uncommon valor. Every year we gather in our cities and towns to remember. We praise our fathers and mothers. We mourn lost brothers and sisters. We miss best friends. And we thank God that we live in a country that is good as well as great.\nIn America, we are blessed to have World War II veterans like Debra Stern to lead us in the \"Pledge of Allegiance.\" We are blessed that hundreds gathered at Royal Palm Memorial Gardens to dedicate a memorial to our most recent veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq. We are blessed that so many in Florida could stop and pause to remember their neighbors and friends and the 35 who have fallen in Iraq.\nIn America, we are blessed. When you stop and think about what it takes for people to risk their lives, say good-bye to their families, and go so far away to serve their country – it is a profound gesture of honor.\nIt symbolizes the spirit of America – that there are men and women who are ready to do what it takes to live and lead by our values. I met so many of them when I fought in Vietnam and I have met them since from Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Their love of country is special. And we will never tire of waving a flag, saying a prayer, or laying a wreath for those who fell to lift the cause of freedom.\nTheir sacrifice calls us to a higher standard. In these dangerous times and in our determination to win the war on terror, we need to be clear about our purposes and our principles. When war and peace, when life and death, when democracy and terror are in the balance, we owe it to our soldiers and our country to shape and follow a coherent policy that will make America safer, stronger, and truer to our ideals.\nLast week, I proposed a new national security policy guided by four imperatives: First, we must lead strong alliances for the post 9/11 world. Second, we must modernize the world's most powerful military to meet new threats. Third, in addition to our military might, we must deploy all that is in America's arsenal -- our diplomacy, our intelligence system, our economic power, and the appeal of our values and ideas. Fourth, to secure our full independence and freedom, we must free America from its dangerous dependence on Middle East oil.\nThese four imperatives are a response to an inescapable reality: the world has changed and war has changed; the enemy is different – and we must think and act anew.\nThese imperatives must guide us as we deal with the greatest threat we face today – the possibility of al Qaeda or other terrorists getting their hands on a nuclear weapon. We know what al Qaeda and terrorists long to do. Osama bin Laden has called obtaining a weapon of mass destruction a sacred duty.\nTake away politics, strip away the labels, the honest questions have to be asked. Since that dark day in September have we done everything we could to secure these dangerous weapons and bomb making materials? Have we taken every step we should to stop North Korea and Iran's nuclear programs? Have we reached out to our allies and forged an urgent global effort to ensure that nuclear weapons and materials are secured?\nThe honest answer, in each of these areas, is that we have done too little, often too late, and even cut back our efforts or turned away from the single greatest threat we face in the world today, a terrorist armed with nuclear weapons.\nThere was a time not so long ago when dealing with the possibility of nuclear war was the most important responsibility entrusted to every American President. The phrase \"having your finger on the nuclear button\" meant something very real to Americans, and to all the world. The Cold War may be over, the nuclear arms race between the Soviet Union and the United States may have ended, but the possibility of terrorists using nuclear weapons is very real indeed. The question before us now is what shadowy figures may someday have their finger on a nuclear button if we don't act. It is time again that we have leadership at the highest levels that treats this threat with the sense of seriousness, urgency, and purpose it demands.\nI can think of no single step that will do more to head off this catastrophe than the proposal I am laying out today. And that is why I am here today to ask that America launch a new mission, that America restore and renew the leadership we once demonstrated for all the world, to prevent the world's deadliest weapons from falling into the world's most dangerous hands. If we secure all bomb making materials, ensure that no new materials are produced for nuclear weapons, and end nuclear weapons programs in hostile states like North Korea and Iran, we can and will dramatically reduce the possibility of nuclear terrorism.\nWe can't eliminate this threat on our own. We must fight this enemy in the same way we fought in World War I, World War II, and the Cold War, by building and leading strong alliances. Our enemy has changed and is not based within one country or one totalitarian empire. But our path to victory is still the same. We must use the might of our alliances.\nWhen I am president, America will lead the world in a mission to lock up and safeguard nuclear weapons material so terrorists can never acquire it. To achieve this goal, we need the active support of our friends and allies around the world. We might all share the same goal: to reduce the threat of nuclear terrorism, but we can't achieve it when our alliances have been shredded.\nIt will take new leadership – the kind of leadership that brings others to us. We can't protect ourselves from these nuclear dangers without the world by our side.\nEarlier this year, my colleague Senator Joe Biden announced the results of a challenge he issued. He asked the directors of our national laboratories whether terrorists could make a nuclear bomb. The bad news is they said \"yes\" – and when challenged to prove it, they constructed a nuclear bomb made entirely from commercial parts that can be bought without breaking any laws, except for obtaining the nuclear material itself. The good news is the materials – the highly enriched uranium and plutonium needed to detonate a bomb – do not occur in nature and are difficult for terrorists to produce on their own – no material, no bomb.\nThe weapons are only in a few countries, but the material to make a bomb exists in dozens of states around the world. Securing this material is a great challenge. But as President Truman said, \"America was not built on fear. America was built on courage, on imagination and unbeatable determination to do the job at hand.\"\nWe know how to reduce this threat. We have the technology to achieve this goal – and with the right leadership, we can achieve it quickly.\nAs president, my number one security goal will be to prevent the terrorists from gaining weapons of mass murder, and ensure that hostile states disarm. It is a daunting goal, but an indisputable one – and we can achieve it.\nI think of other great challenges this nation has set for itself. In 1960, President Kennedy challenged us to go to the moon. Our imagination and sense of discovery took us there. In 1963, just months after the Cuban Missile Crisis nearly brought the world to nuclear disaster President Kennedy called for a nuclear test ban treaty. At the height of the Cold War, he challenged America and the Soviet Union to pursue a strategy \"not toward ...annihilation, but toward a strategy of peace.\" We answered that challenge. And in time, a hotline between Moscow and Washington was established. The nuclear tests stopped. The air cleared and hope emerged on the horizon.\nWhen America sees a great problem or great potential, it is in our collective character to set our sights on that horizon and not stop working until we reach it. In our mission to reduce the threat of nuclear terrorism, we should never feel helpless. We should feel empowered that the successes in our past will guide us toward a safer, more secure world.\nVulnerable nuclear material anywhere is a threat to everyone, everywhere.\nWe need to employ a layered strategy to keep the worst weapons from falling into the worst hands. A strategy that invokes our non-military strength early enough and effectively enough so military force doesn't become our only option. America must lead and build an international consensus for early preventive action.\nHere's what we must do. The first step is to safeguard all bomb making material worldwide. That means making sure we know where they are, and then locking them up and securing them wherever they are. Our approach should treat all nuclear materials needed for bombs as if they were bombs.\nMore than a decade has passed since the Berlin Wall came down. But Russia still has nearly 20,000 nuclear weapons, and enough nuclear material to produce 50,000 more Hiroshima-sized bombs.\nFor most of these weapons and materials, cooperative security upgrades have not been completed – the world is relying on whatever measures Russia has taken on its own. And at the current pace, it will take 13 years to secure potential bomb material in the former Soviet Union. We cannot wait that long. I will ensure that we remove this material entirely from sites that can't be adequately secured during my first term.\nIt is hard to believe that we actually secured less bomb making material in the two years after 9/11 than we had in the two years before.\nAt my first summit with the Russian President, I will seek an agreement to sweep aside the key obstacles slowing our efforts to secure Russia's nuclear stockpiles. But this threat is not limited to the former Soviet Union.\nBecause terror at home can begin far away, we have to make sure that in every nation the stockpiles are safeguarded. If I am president, the United States will lead an alliance to establish and enforce an international standard for the safe custody of nuclear weapons and materials.\nWe will help states meet such standards by expanding the scope of the Nunn-Lugar program passed over a decade ago to deal with the unsecured weapons and materials in the former Soviet Union. For years, the administration has underfunded this vital program. For a fraction of what we have already spent in Iraq, we can ensure that every nuclear weapon and every pound of potential bomb material will be secured and accounted for.\nThis is not just a question of resources. As president, I will make it a priority and overcome the bureaucratic walls that have caused delay and inaction in Russia so we can finish the important work of securing weapons material there and around the world.\nThe Administration just announced plans to remove potential bomb material from vulnerable sites outside the former Soviet Union over the next ten years. We simply can't afford another decade of this danger. My plan will safeguard this bomb making material in four years. We can't wait – and I won't wait when I am president.\nThe second step is to prevent the creation of new materials that are being produced for nuclear weapons. America must lead an international coalition to halt, and then verifiably ban, all production of highly enriched uranium and plutonium for use in nuclear weapons -- permanently capping the world's nuclear weapons stockpiles.\nDespite strong international support for such a ban, this Administration is stalling, and endlessly reviewing the need for such a policy.\nIn addition, we must strengthen the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to close the loophole that lets countries develop nuclear weapons capabilities under the guise of a peaceful, civilian nuclear power program.\nThe third step is to reduce excess stocks of materials and weapons. If America is asking the world to join our country in a shared mission to reduce this nuclear threat, then why would the world listen to us if our own words do not match our deeds?\nAs President, I will stop this Administration's program to develop a whole new generation of bunker-busting nuclear bombs. This is a weapon we don't need. And it undermines our credibility in persuading other nations. What kind of message does it send when we're asking other countries not to develop nuclear weapons, but developing new ones ourselves?\nWe must work with the Russians to accelerate the \"blending down\" of highly enriched uranium and the disposition of Russian plutonium stocks so they can never be used in a nuclear weapon.\nWe don't need a world with more usable nuclear weapons. We need a world where terrorists can't ever use one. That should be our focus in the post 9/11 world.\nOur fourth step is to end the nuclear weapons programs in states like North Korea and Iran.\nThis Administration has been fixated on Iraq while the nuclear dangers from North Korea have multiplied. We know that North Korea has sold ballistic missiles and technology in the past. And according to recent reports, North Korean uranium ended up in Libyan hands. The North Koreans have made it clear to the world – and to the terrorists – that they are open for business and will sell to the highest bidder.\nWe should have no illusions about Kim Jong II, so any agreement must have rigorous verification and lead to complete and irreversible elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons program. For eighteen months, we've essentially negotiated over the shape of the table while the North Koreans allegedly have made enough new fuel to make six to nine nuclear bombs.\nWe should maintain the six party talks, but we must also be prepared to talk directly with North Korea. This problem is too urgent to allow China, or others at the table, to speak for us. And we must be prepared to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that addresses the full range of issues of concern to us and our allies.\nWe must also meet the mounting danger on the other side of Asia. While we have been preoccupied in Iraq, next door in Iran, a nuclear program has been reportedly moving ahead. Let me say it plainly: a nuclear armed Iran is unacceptable. An America whose interest and allies could be on the target list must no longer sit on the sidelines. It is critical that we work with our allies to resolve those issues.\nThis is why strengthening the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is so critical. The Iranians claim they're simply trying to meet domestic energy needs. We should call their bluff, and organize a group of states that will offer the nuclear fuel they need for peaceful purposes and take back the spent fuel so they can't divert it to build a weapon. If Iran does not accept this, their true motivations will be clear. The same goes for other countries possibly seeking nuclear weapons. We will oppose the construction in any new countries of any new facilities to make nuclear materials, and lead a global effort to prevent the export of the necessary technology to Iran.\nWe also need to strengthen enforcement and verification. We must make rigorous inspection protocols mandatory, and refocus the mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency to stop the spread of nuclear weapons material.\nNext, we must work with every country to tighten export controls, stiffen penalties, and beef up law enforcement and intelligence sharing, to make absolutely sure that a disaster like the AQ Khan black market network, which grew out of Pakistan's nuclear program, can never happen again. We must also take steps to reduce tension between India and Pakistan and guard against the possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands there.\nSo let it be clear: finally and fundamentally, preventing nuclear terrorism is our most urgent priority to provide for America's long term security. That is why I will appoint a National Coordinator for Nuclear Terrorism and Counterproliferation who will work with me in the White House to marshal every effort and every ally, to combat an incalculable danger.\nWe have to do everything we can to stop a nuclear weapon from ever reaching our shore – and that mission begins far away. We have to secure nuclear weapons and materials at the source so that searching the containers here at the Port of Palm Beach isn't our only line of defense – it is our last line of defense.\nThis is not an easy topic: it can be frightening. At this hour, stockpiles go unguarded, bomb making materials sit in forgotten facilities, and terrorists plot away. They sit in unassuming rooms all across the globe. They have their technology. They have their scientists. All they need is that material. But we can stop them. Remember. No material. No bomb. No nuclear terrorism.\nWe are living through days of great and unprecedented risks. But Americans have never surrendered to fear. Today, we must not avert our eyes, or pretend it's not there – or think that we can simply wait it out. That is not our history – or our hope.\nLast Saturday, I attended the dedication of the World War II memorial. I had the honor to sit next to a brave man, Joe Lesniewski, who was one of the original \"Band of Brothers\" from the ‘Easy Company\" of the 101st Airborne Division. He's part of the Greatest Generation and jumped into enemy territory during the invasion of Normandy. Like so many other young men that day, he looked fear in the face and conquered it. June 6th – this coming Saturday – marks the anniversary of that day which saved the free world.\nSixty years ago, more than 43,000 young men were ready to storm Omaha Beach. Their landing craft were heading for an open beach, where they faced a wall of concrete and bullets. They knew there was an overwhelming chance that they might die before their boots hit the sand.\nBut they jumped into the shallow waters and fought their way ashore. Because at the end of the beach, beyond the cliff was the hope of a safer world. That is what Americans do. We face a challenge – no matter how ominous – because we know that on the other side of hardship resides hope.\nAs president, I will not wait or waver in the face of the new threats of this new era. I will build and lead strong alliances. I will deploy every tool at our disposal. I know it will not be easy, but the greatest victories for peace and freedom never are. There are no cake-walks in the contest with terrorists and lawless states.\nWe have to climb this cliff together so that we, too, can reach the other side of hardship and live in a world that no longer fears the unknowable enemy and the looming mushroom cloud on the horizon.\nWe must lead this effort not just for our own safety, but for the good of the world. As President Truman said, \"Our goal is collective security...If we can work in a spirit of understanding and mutual respect, we can fulfill this solemn obligation that rests upon us.\"\nJust as he led America to face the threat of communism, so too, we must now face the twin threats of nuclear proliferation and terrorism. This is a great challenge for our generation – and the stakes are as high as they were on D-Day and in President Truman's time. For the sake of all the generations to come, we will meet this test and we will succeed.", "timestamp": "2004-06-01", "title": "\"New Strategies to Meet New Threats\": Remarks of John Kerry"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29698", "text": "Thank you General Wilson for that kind introduction, and thank you all for coming today. General Wilson is the quintessential example of what we mean by the opportunity Army. He rose from private to Commander of the Army Materiel Command, supplying the Army with everything from beans, to bullets, to boots. And I'm delighted that he's with us today.\nI can't tell you what a treat it is for me to stand here this afternoon in this remarkable library celebrating a remarkable man. In word and deed, Harry Truman embodied the highest ideals of the Greatest Generation. He desegregated our armed forces. He created the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe from the ground up, and gave life to the United Nations and NATO. And he set this nation and the world on a wise and patient path to win the Cold War without a third World War.\nPresident Truman understood that our military is only as good as the men and women in its ranks. And I know that he would be as proud of the soldiers who serve this country today as he was of those who sacrificed for our country sixty years ago.\nIn the spirit of all the men and women in uniform we honor at this time every year, let me offer this pledge: As President, I will always remember that America's security begins and ends with the soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine – with every man and every woman in our armed services standing a post somewhere in the world. Today, we salute each and every one of them for their commitment, strength, and extraordinary courage – especially those serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. They, like all veterans of wars past, deserve our prayers and then, when they come home, they deserve the respect and support of a grateful nation. After all, the first definition of patriotism is to keep faith with those who have worn the uniform of the United States.\nAnd the first duty of a commander in chief is to make America strong and keep Americans safe. A week ago in Seattle, I outlined a new strategy of national security based on four imperatives. First, we must lead strong alliances for the post 9-11 world. Second, to secure our full independence and freedom, we must free America from its dangerous dependence on Mideast oil. Third, in addition to our military might, we must deploy all that is in America's arsenal – our diplomacy, our intelligence, our economic power, and the power of our values and ideas.\nAnd fourth is the imperative I will discuss today: We must modernize the world's most powerful military to meet new and different threats. The Bush Administration was right to call for the \"transformation\" of the military. But their version of transformation was directed at fighting classic conventional wars, rather than the dangers we now face in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in the war against al Qaeda. To rise to the challenges we face, we must strengthen our military, including our Special Forces; improve our technology; and task our National Guard with Homeland Security.\nAnd there's a reason I decided to come here, to the birthplace of President Truman, to deliver this speech.\nIn 1945, Franklin Roosevelt died unexpectedly, leaving his vice president of only eighty-three days, Harry S Truman, to finish a war that had claimed the lives of 400,000 Americans. Beyond the war, the new President inherited a shattered Europe and a divided world, with the warmth of democracy on one side and the chill of communism on the other.\nIn describing what he saw before him that day, Harry Truman said: \"I feel as though the moon and all the stars and all the planets have fallen upon me.\" In many ways, they had. But that plain spoken son of Missouri rose to a responsibility as grave as any given to any President. In a world divided between freedom and tyranny, his decisions set a course that saved the future of humanity.\nTo contain communism, and build a mighty alliance, Truman had to rebuild our military both to deter conventional aggression and the threat of nuclear weapons, because, as he put it, \"The will for peace without the strength for peace is of no avail.\" He modernized our armed forces by creating the Department of Defense and the Air Force – the greatest change in our nation's military structure since the beginning of the Republic.\nToday, in the post 9-11 world, we stand at another historic crossroad, at another moment when the old enemy is gone but we face a new threat. We must change if we are to meet and defeat the danger. We must reshape our military and prepare it for the risks and tasks of a new era.\nTerrorist groups like Al Qaeda and its copycat killers are claiming the right to execute the innocent. They confuse murder with martyrdom and fanaticism with faith. They use terror as a sword and religion as a shield.\nThey present the central national security challenge of our generation. But they are unlike any other adversary our nation has ever confronted. They have no president, capital city, territory, army, or national identity. We are not absolutely certain how they are organized or how many operatives they have. But we know the destruction they can inflict. We saw it here in America on September 11th. We saw it in Bali and in Madrid, and across the Middle East. And now we see it day after day in Iraq.\nTo defeat these threats, we must draw on the four imperatives I described earlier – especially the need to modernize America's military.\nDespite all its talk of transforming that military, the Bush Administration has done far too little to adapt our forces to the new missions they must undertake.\nWe went into Iraq with too few troops to prevent looting and crime, and we failed to secure nearly a million tons of conventional weapons now being used against our troops. We failed to build alliances and squandered the opportunity to generate wider support inside Iraq, in the Arab world, and among the major powers. These mistakes have complicated our mission: a stable Iraq with a representative government secure in its borders.\nBut as hard as it is to believe, there is little evidence that this Administration has learned from its mistakes. The rhetoric of toughness is not enough to make us safe. We need tough decisions to strengthen the American military, so we can find and get the terrorists before they get us. As President, I will build a highly-trained military, with more ground troops and Special Forces not just to win war, but to win the peace.\nInstead of over-relying on weapons and tactics to fight the battles of the past, against enemies out in the desert or on open seas, we must build mobile and modern forces to prevail against terrorists hiding in caves or in the heart of a city. We must broaden our capabilities to create a military ready for any mission, from armored battle to urban warfare to homeland security. Yes, we must invest in missile defense. But not at the cost of other pressing priorities. We cannot afford to spend billions to deploy an unproven missile defense system. Not only is it not ready, but it's the wrong priority for a war on terror where the enemy strikes with a bomb in the back of a truck, or a vial of anthrax in a briefcase.\nThis is part of a larger problem. From day one, this Administration has been obsessed with threats from other states -- instead of opening their eyes to the perils of the new century: terrorist organizations with or without ties to rogue nations and failed states that can become their sanctuaries. These are the enemies our military is facing. And this is where we must train, arm, and equip our military to win.\nIn addition, we must secure our own democracy and our own borders. Homeland security must be a top priority of the president. Today, it's too often something this Administration just pays lip service to when the cameras are rolling.\nWe can't meet the new threats of this new century with a military from the last one. We must always be ready for strategic and conventional missions. But we must also be committed to build the strongest possible military to meet the new and greatest threats. I'm running for president to build a new military for a new time.\nMy first order of business as commander in chief will be to expand America's active duty forces. Not to increase the number of soldiers in Iraq, but to add 40,000 new soldiers to prevent and prepare for other possible conflicts. The fact is, the war in Iraq has taken a real toll on our armed services. Nine out of ten active duty Army divisions – ninety percent of the Army's active duty combat divisions – are committed to Iraq, either currently there, preparing to go, or recently returned. That is a dangerous and potentially disastrous course that limits our capacity to respond to other crises.\nThe war has been especially tough on the Army's critical post-war specialists. Civil affairs. Military police. Combat support units. Psychological operations units. All are in short supply. All are nearly exhausted.\nTo pick up the slack, since 9-11, we've called up our Guard and Reserves at historic levels. Currently there are more than 165,000 Guardsman and Reservists on active duty. In fact, 40 percent of our forces in Iraq are from the Reserve and the Guard. They are America's workers, doctors, mechanics, and first-responders. Some have been on the ground in Iraq for as many as 15 months – much longer than was expected or promised. And many of these units are being pushed the limit.\nThe people of Missouri understand this situation well. More than 800 of your sons and daughters have had their deployments extended and their homecomings delayed. The Administration is even planning to send troops from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment to Iraq -- a unit whose primary mission has been to prepare other units for future deployments.\nThe effect is clear: our soldiers are stretched too thin.\nThe Administration's answer has been to put band-aids on the problem. They have effectively used a stop-loss policy as a back door draft. They have extended tours of duty, delayed retirements, and prevented enlisted personnel from leaving the service. Just yesterday, the Army announced this would affect even more soldiers whose units are headed to Iraq and Afghanistan. By employing these expedients, they've increased the forces by 30,000 troops.\nBut this has happened on the backs of the men and women who've already fulfilled their obligation to the armed forces and to our country – and it runs counter to the traditions of an all-volunteer military. Because they're serving one tour after another, our soldiers are not getting the training they need or the rest they deserve. Military families are under incredible strain as it becomes harder and harder to balance the demands of family life and military duty. This is especially true at a time when more than half of our military is married – a dramatic increase since Vietnam. When you add it up, we are in danger of creating another hollow Army – a grave concern that I've heard time and again over the last few months from active duty personnel. I heard it in Pittsburgh from an Army Reserve Captain who had just returned from Iraq. Like me, he fears that our military will not be ready for the next mission. That's not the way to make America safer.\nThe 40,000 new troops I am adding will not be soldiers who've already been on the front lines, but new volunteers trained and ready to defend their country. And this will help relieve the strain on our troops; it will bring more of our soldiers, guardsmen and reservists back home to their families and get them time for the new training they need.\nBut numbers alone won't win the war in Iraq or the war on terror. We need to create a \"New Total Force.\" Our military must be prepared to defeat any enemy, anytime, any place. And our soldiers must be capable of success in any conflict.\nAs president, I will double our Special Forces capability to fight the war on terror. That's the second part of my plan to modernize the military. Our Special Forces are the troops who land behind enemy lines, conduct counter-terrorism operations, perform reconnaissance missions, and gather intelligence. In Afghanistan, after September 11th, they took the fight to the Taliban with remarkable creativity. They also train local forces to take on the responsibilities themselves and they build the relationships that are vital for our victory in the war on terror. We saw what they could do during the Iraq war, when two teams of American Green Berets totaling 31 men worked with Kurdish troops to defeat an Iraqi force numbering in the hundreds. The victory at the battle of Debecka Pass is a tribute to the flexibility, training, and courage of American Special Forces – all essential to winning the war on terror.\nWe must also recognize that the battle itself is only half the mission. In any conflict, we need an expanded, well-trained force, with soldiers prepared for both war and its aftermath.\nAs President, I will also increase our civil affairs personnel – those who arrive on the scene after the conflict is over and help win the peace. They work with local leaders and officials to get the schools back in shape, the hospitals reopened, and banks up and running.\nWe also need – and a Kerry Administration will provide – more military police, because public order is a critical step to winning the peace. At the same time, we should move greater responsibility for non-military missions to civilian agencies to ease the burden on our troops.\nAs President, I will build a modern military, with the best trained troops and the most modern equipment and technology. That's the third part of my plan. The war in Iraq has left us with a hefty bill to pay. Our equipment is worn from the daily assault of battle and the harsh effects of an unforgiving desert. We must repair, replace, and upgrade it to maintain the highest level of readiness.\nWe can't have a 21st century military unless we're using 21st century technology and preparing our forces for 21st century threats. We need a military that is equipped for the next fight, not the last one. That means educating, training, and arming every soldier with state-of-the-art equipment, whether it's body armor or weapons. And it means employing the most sophisticated communications to help our troops prevail and protect themselves in battle. Right now, the technology exists to let a soldier see what's over the next hill or around the next bend in the road. Every soldier in every unit should have access to that modern breakthrough, which can be the difference between life and death. As president, I will see to it that they do.\nI will also accelerate the development of non-lethal technologies, like directed energy weapons, that can incapacitate the enemy, without risking the lives of innocent bystanders. The need for this technology is driven by pure military strategy. With more of the world's populations living in cities, it's more critical than ever that our military be able to carry out their missions with the least harm to civilians. As we saw in Fallujah and Najaf, our forces may advance on the ground, but innocent casualties can cost us victory in the minds of the people. This is especially true in the war on terror, where our forces must track down leaders and their cells no matter where they're hiding, even if it's in the center of a densely populated city.\nTechnology also plays a critical role in keeping the worst weapons out of the hands of rogue states and terrorists. On Tuesday, I proposed a broad agenda to limit the spread of nuclear weapons and material. But we must recognize if the worst does happen, and dangerous weapons technology falls into the wrong hands, the President must have at his disposal every instrument of force necessary to destroy those weapons before they are used against the United States, its citizens, or its allies. Before the war in Afghanistan, there were troubling reports that our military lacked forces specifically trained and targeted to seizing and dismantling nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. We simply can't win the war on terror if we can't control the world's most lethal weapons. As president, I will build new forces that specialize in finding, securing, and destroying weapons of mass destruction and the facilities that build them.\nHowever, technology alone isn't the answer. We must educate and train our forces differently. This commitment to innovation must be wedded to a continuing investment in the men and women of the American military. Their training, education, and professional development will transform this new technology into real military power.\nBut one thing we've all learned in the war on terror is that America can't lead abroad unless we're secure at home. While this Administration has taken steps to protect our borders, they've left out a key asset in the fight on terror – our National Guard. The Guard has kept our nation safe since the militias gathered at Lexington and Concord. They've served in every war, and they're serving now. In fact, after September 11th, they were the first ones called on to line city streets, guard bridges, and patrol our airports.\nBut today, too many of them are far away from home and the Guard as a whole is not integrated into an effective strategy for homeland security. The National Guard was intended to complement, not be a substitute for, active duty forces. Sending thousands of National Guard members to Iraq has actually weakened our ability to defend our own country. Members of the Guard are first responders across the country – fire fighters, police officers, and emergency medical technicians. To take them out of their communities is to take down a critical first line of defense. That's no way to protect America.\nAs president, I will make homeland security one of the primary missions of the National Guard. While the military can't solve the entire homeland security challenge, the National Guard can make an important contribution to the mission. That's the fourth part of my plan – modernizing our National Guard. I will assign Guard units to a standing joint task force, commanded by a General from the Guard. This task force will prepare and, if necessary, execute a coordinated strategy for homeland safety, working with the states and the federal government to react in times of crisis.\nJust as it was in the time of Harry Truman, and in all the years of the Cold War, the job of commander in chief is now central to the presidency. As President, I will use military force to protect our interests anywhere in the world, whenever necessary. But strong leadership demands more than the willingness to use force. It means directing the use of the right tools at the right time for the right purpose and the right cause. Only then will we be strong and respected around the world.\nStrong leadership means striking a balance between the Department of Defense and the other agencies focused on America's national security. It means coordinating our national power rather than competing for bureaucratic power. It means building a first-rate intelligence community, because no president can act wisely without it.\nStrong leadership means listening to and respecting the advice, wisdom, and experience of our professional military – and never letting ideology trump the truth. It means working with Congress in a bipartisan fashion to make our military stronger.\nStrong leadership means setting goals for a new military, insisting on progress, and seeing the mission through to success.\nStrong leadership means building alliances to help win the war on terror and stem the spread of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons.\nIf Harry Truman were standing here today, I know that he would believe, as I do, that America's strength demands a new military for a new time – what he once called \"the strongest, toughest and most enduring forces in the world.\"\nAbove all, as President, I will never forget the pledge with which I began today: I will always remember that our security and our strength begins with a single soldier, standing a single post somewhere in the world. And we should be grateful to men and women willing to do it, with such grace and such courage.", "timestamp": "2004-06-03", "title": "\"Strengthening Our Military\": Remarks of John Kerry"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29699", "text": "I can't tell you how privileged I am to share this special moment in your lives. And by chance it falls on a day that commemorates a moment that will always live in American history. As we know all too sadly, this weekend also marks the passing of a modern giant. I want to focus on your future, but in the past we are all so conscious of now, there is strength and inspiration for your lives. First, let me tell you how honored I am to be part of the class of 2004.\nI know it's out of the ordinary to have a graduation speaker who hasn't passed Mr. Harley's math class, but I'm here because of a letter I received from an extra-ordinary young man.\nA few months ago, your classmate Brandon Spader wrote to me that you could all use, \"a strong flame to brighten the future of [your] lives.\"\nBrandon is right. I wish, just as I wished for my own daughters on their graduation day and just as your parents wish for you today, that we could send you out into a world of peace, a world of justice, a world that is fair and free for every person on this Earth.\nYet we know this is not our world. Your generation will face great challenges, and you will find, as you already have, that life brings setbacks as well as success, hardship as well as hope. And when it gets dark, you'll need that strong flame to light your way.\nSixty years ago today, an earlier generation faced down darkness and lit their way with a courage that saved freedom in the world. On June 6th, 1944, more than 73,000 young men were on landing crafts steaming toward the Normandy shore. Many were not a day older than any of you. They left their homes, their families, their friends and yes their high schools to wage and win the decisive battle. They did not know if they would ever see America again.\nBut eighteen- and nineteen-year-olds on the hundreds of landing crafts approaching that beach held their rifles over their heads, jumped into the shallow waters and fought their way ashore. Because at the end of the beach, beyond the cliff was the horizon of a better world. That is what Americans do. We face a challenge – no matter how great – because we know that on the other side there is always hope.\nI had the enormous privilege of going to Normandy to celebrate the 50th anniversary of D-Day with my friend Senator Fritz Hollings, who served in World War II. And I stood in awe as old townspeople came up and touched him and tugged at his sleeve saying 'thank you' for 'what you did for us.'\nToday, as we mark your graduation, we also celebrate the greatest generation.\nAnd that coincidence tells a powerful truth: Now it is your generation's turn to find the greatness that's in you.\nLook around you. Look at all the proud parents and teachers. Look at the smiles on their faces and the tears in their eyes.\nThey believe in you. America believes in you. And the best way to show how much you believe in America is to give something of yourselves to your country as well as your future careers.\nAfter all, our greatest strength – our greatest responsibility as citizens – is service. And it is the people who answer the call every day who keep America strong. So many of you have already served right here in your hometown. As Bedford Angels, you have given your hearts and your hands to lift up the sick, the homeless, and families in need. And in the years to come, your service can change a neighborhood – or a nation. You will not do it alone; none of us can. We do it together – in the sum total of all our contributions and caring.\nI know that Brandon is going off to the Air Force Academy, many of you are enlisting in the military, and others will go on to higher education to become tomorrow's teachers, business leaders, ministers, and public servants.\nBut no matter what work you do, there is other work to be done.\nThere are senior citizens who need a friend, there are children who need mentors, and there are communities that need help and healing. And across the oceans, there are not only enemies to be faced, but people everywhere ready to open their hearts to Peace Corps volunteers who show the world the generosity of the American spirit.\nIf you're willing to get involved, to lend your voices, your energy and your time, in the years of your youth, you can surprise those who underestimate the idealism and commitment of the young. You can prove in your own lives the truth of something that was written about this nation when it was young: \"America is great because America is good.\"\nMy own father served in the Army Air Corps during World War II. He volunteered well before the war even began. And while he was on duty, and my mother was volunteering, she sent him a letter. \"You have no idea of the ways in which one can be useful right now,\" she wrote. \"There's something for everyone to do.\"\nHalf a century later, in a very different but equally fateful time, there is something for all of us to do, a place for all to serve, no room on the sidelines, and no challenge too daunting.\nWe're a nation of optimists. We're the can-do people. And we just have to believe in ourselves.\nYesterday, we lost one of our greatest optimists. President Reagan's belief in America was infectious.\nAnd because of the way he led, he taught us that there was a difference between strong beliefs and bitter partisanship.\nHe was the voice of America in good times and in grief. On another D-Day twenty years ago, he stood on that windswept cliff at Normandy and paid an imperishable tribute to the glorious boys of Point du Hoc. Many who had survived were there with him that day, and he spoke the nation's heart. When he stood at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, he said, \"Mr. Gorbechev, tear down this wall.\" He spoke for our country, for the eternal cause of liberty, and most of all for the millions imprisoned behind that wall who would soon after tear it down. Free men and women everywhere will forever remember and honor President Reagan's role in ending the Cold War. He really did believe that communism could be ended in his lifetime, and he helped to make it happen. Perhaps President Reagan's greatest monument isn't any building or any structure that bears his name, but the absence of the Berlin Wall.\nWhen we lost the brave astronauts in the Challenger tragedy, he reminded us that, \"Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.\"\nYesterday, his own journey ended a long and storied trip that spanned most of the American century – and shaped one of the greatest victories of freedom.\nToday in the face of new challenges, President Reagan's example reminds us that we must move forward with optimism and resolve.\nHe was our oldest president, but he made America young again.\nWe pause for a moment to pray for his family, and the wife he loved in a way all the world could see. And to the end, she loved him with courage and complete devotion.\nThe American spirit wears no political label. In service to others and yes, in sacrifice for our country, there are no Republicans; there are no Democrats; there are only Americans.\nWhen Brandon wrote to me, he asked about \"ideas and values\" that could lift us up and \"make our country greater than it has ever been.\"\nWhen I look for the answer, I look at you: your commitment to a cause bigger than yourselves. You are the ones who will lift up this land up with your ideas and your values, with your faith and your love of family and country.\nYou are the ones who will always stand up for what is just and what is right in America. That is what has always made the difference.\nYou are what Robert Kennedy had in mind when he warned against a sense of futility. He said \"each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.\"\nI know your idealism is not something you wear on your sleeves. Sometimes it is tested by events and disappointments. But above all today, I ask you to keep it. In it, you can find a lifetime of strength and service.\nAnd America needs it: your idealism is our hope.\nNow you are ready, as the words at the doors of Bedford High tell you, to depart and serve.\nAnd I know that as you hold on to all that brought you here today, you will reach out and reach higher and give something back.\nCongratulations, God bless you, and good luck.", "timestamp": "2004-06-06", "title": "Commencement Address at Bedford High School in Toledo, Ohio"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29701", "text": "Thank you for being here. And thank you Chris for that kind introduction. Today is the first day of summer. But the first day of summer here in the mountains feels like the first day of fall back east.\nChris, your story is a constant reminder that one person can overcome adversity and make a difference.\nListening to you just now, I know that with focus and determination America can lead the world in science and research so that one day you can walk. To stand in the shadow of the Rockies and dream for anything less for you, for your family, and for the thousands of others who have suffered the same fate, would be to go against the Denver spirit. After all, we're in the \"Mile High City\" and in a country with \"Mile High Dreams.\"\nYou know, I think of those Americans who came west and saw those mountains. They didn't buckle in fear at their grand scale. They said we're going to scale them, and keep going. And when we come to settings like this one and parks like the Civic Center, we are reminded that we are part of something bigger than ourselves.\nThat's what great urban green spaces do – they pull people together by giving them a place to gather in the heart of the city. Since 1926, people have gathered here for public concerts, public vigils as in the wake of the Columbine tragedy, and for celebrations like Cinco de Mayo and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. And I just want to say that the renovations to the amphitheater look amazing.\nAnd the man who helped build this park – Mayor Robert Speer – once said, \"Give while you live.\" That's what he did for Colorado and that is what we're going to do for America.\nThat's why we're here. You bring us one step closer to an America stronger at home and respected in the world-- today brings us one step closer to the end of the Bush administration.\nWe're here to fight for good-paying jobs that let American workers actually get ahead.\nWe're here to make health care a right for all of our people.\nWe're here to make this nation energy independent.\nWe're here to build a strong military, and lead strong alliances, so that our military is never overextended and young Americans are never put in harm's way because we went in alone.\nAnd we're here to build an economy of the future by investing in science, technology, and higher education, which is really what I want to focus on today.\nYou know, there is always something special for me about coming to Colorado. I was born here at the Fitzsimons Army Hospital when my father was a pilot in World War II. My father and my mother taught me the value of service.\nI've always been determined to give something back to my country – as a soldier, as a prosecutor, as a Senator. And now, I'm running for President. It's been a great adventure and a great privilege. So many of you have welcomed Teresa and me and our kids into your homes and hearts. You have told us the stories of your lives – and they have become the work of my life.\nThe poet Langston Hughes told the stories in this way: \"Let America be America again. Let it be the dream it used to be\" – for those \"whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain, whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain must bring back our mighty dream again.\"\nIn 2004, we have to bring back our mighty dream again. We have to make America all that it can become.\nYou know, working families all across our country are living by the oldest and greatest of American values – hard work, service, and caring for one another. And I'm running for president because I believe that our government should live by those values, too.\nMore than a million Americans who were working three years ago have lost their jobs. And the new jobs finally being created pay an average of $9,000 less a year. Colorado, we need a President who fights for your job as hard as he fights for his own.\nWe also need a president who fights for the working men and women of this country. As wages are going down, your health care costs are going up; your tuitions are going up; your bills are going up. In the last three years, here in Colorado, health care premiums climbed more than $2,600 and child care costs increased by more than $2,000. But guess what didn't go up? You're right, your wages! Family income has dropped by more than $1,400.\nThat's why last week, I talked about my economic plan to build up our great middle class by lowering your taxes so your incomes go up; cutting the deficit in half by rolling back the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, and honoring middle class values so you can balance work and family. I'm running for president because I want an economy that strengthens and expands the middle class, not one that squeezes it – Americans shouldn't just be working and working for the economy-- the economy should be working all Americans.\nI have a plan to put good paying jobs at the heart of our economy. And when I'm president, American taxpayers will never again subsidize the loss of their own jobs. I'm running for president, because I want an economy that's built on people and products, not perks and privileges.\nThis week, I want to talk about my plan to create an economy of the future – one that's based on innovation, ingenuity, and imagination. By harnessing the brain power of the best and brightest among us we can break new frontiers in science and technology and make our economy strong again. We can create the jobs of the future, improve our quality of life, and once again tap into America's greatest resource – our people and our sense of discovery.\nWe have always had this drive as a country to see around corners. To wonder \"What if?\" What if this plane takes flight at Kitty Hawk? What if we could go to the moon? What if we could put millions of pages on to one tiny computer chip? What if we could map our entire DNA? What if we could cure cancer, Parkinson's, AIDS, and Alzheimer's?\nJust when it seems we've reached a plateau or come across a problem too difficult to solve, there is someone, somewhere in America who asks \"what if?\"\n\"What if\" is, in its own way, a uniquely American question – a question that hasn't been asked enough over the last three years. Americans deserve a president who believes in science! And the American people deserve a president who understands that when America invests in science and technology and higher education we can build a new and stronger economy for the 21st century.\nTomorrow, I will focus on the ways we can create a business environment that develops and strengthens new technologies, and how we can create universal access to broadband – a technology that can transform our country and create jobs. If Bangalore and India can be completely wired, then so should all of Colorado and all of America. Our leadership in science and technology is essential for a strong economy and a strong national defense and effective homeland security.\nAnd on Thursday, I will talk about my plan to build the workforce of the future by investing in lifelong learning, helping more Americans go to and graduate from college, and encouraging more women and minorities to become involved in math and science.\nToday, I want to discuss my plan for an America the leads the world in science. Recently we've seen reports that other countries are spending and investing more in science. America has been losing its lead. As President, I will see to it that America is once again at the forefront of scientific discovery.\nWe need that to cure diseases, lower health care costs, and invest in new research and technologies that will create the good paying jobs of the next decade and generation.\nFirst, we need a president who will once again embrace our tradition of looking toward the future and new discoveries with hope based on scientific facts, not fear. That's what presidents are supposed to do. Franklin Roosevelt built great national laboratories. Abraham Lincoln created the National Academy of Sciences. President Eisenhower established the White House Science Advisor. President Kennedy started America on the path that ended up with a man setting foot on the moon. And President Clinton helped lead us to a map of the entire human genome. Presidents think big and dream big. And nowhere is it more important to do so than crossing the new horizons of science and technology.\nI am proud that today 47 Nobel Laureates have sent an open letter to America in support of my campaign and our cause to invest and lead the world in science. As president, I will listen to the advice of our scientists so I can make the best decisions. Their reports and evaluations will be open so that you can make informed decisions as well. This is your future and I will let science guide us, not ideology.\nSecond, we need to invest in science and new technologies that may help cure diseases, start great new industries and deepen our understanding of the world in which we live. That's why I will increase our funding to the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and other important agencies and initiatives that promote crucial research. These advances have the opportunity to do so much good in the world and new technologies like nanotechnology and clean energy have the potential to transform the American economy. Nationally, Colorado ranks 8th in the total number of nanotech firms.\nThis state's economy is driven by cable TV, satellite, and telecommunications. These industries powered much of Colorado's economic growth during the 1990s. During that decade, the population of this state grew by 31%, but thanks to the economic boost of science and technology, unemployment fell to 2.5% in January 2001. It is clear – these technological advances are bringing good paying jobs to Colorado.\nAnd finally, we must lift the barriers that stand in the way of stem cell research and push the boundaries of medical exploration so that researchers can find treatments that are there, if only they are allowed to look. And we should do this while providing strict ethical oversight.\nMore than 100 million Americans – just like Chris – have illnesses and injuries that one day could be cured or treated with stem-cell therapy. Stem cells could replace damaged heart cells or cells destroyed by cancer. Stem cells may have the power to calm the hand of an uncle with Parkinson's, and slow the loss of a grandmother's memory. So many Americans have looked at me with tears in their eyes and asked me to help them find a cure for a daughter, a son, a parent who's suffering from diseases that are controlling their future. By supporting stem cell therapy, we have the possibility to control the future. Not only can we reduce the economic cost of healthcare, we can reduce the emotional and social cost of families. We did it with polio, we did it with small pox, we did it with TB, we can do it again.\nAs America said good-bye to Ronald Reagan we also honored the devotion and love of his wife Nancy. Her pleas for stem cell research joined the pleas of millions across this country and reinforces in all of us the need to tear down every wall today that keeps us from finding the cures of tomorrow. I have full faith that our scientists will go forward with a moral compass – with humane values and sound ethics guiding the way.\nIf we pursue the limitless potential of science – and trust that we can use it wisely – we will save millions of lives and earn the gratitude of future generations. We have the potential to do so much good while at the same time meeting some very practical challenges – lowering health care costs and creating new jobs.\nIt's about investing in the future of our country. And when I am your president, I won't let ideology and fear stand in the way!\nWhen America sees a problem or a great possibility, it is in our collective character to set our sights on the horizon and not stop working until we get there. That's what America does best – and now we need to let America be America again so we can lead in scientific discoveries and advances!\nThat's how we make America strong at home. That's how we build an economy for the 21st century that creates good paying jobs. And we can chart this course together.\nYou know, when I was in Vietnam, I served on a small boat on the Mekong Delta with men who came from places as diverse as South Carolina and Iowa ... Arkansas and California.\nWe were literally all in the same boat – and we came together as one. No one asked us our politics. No one cared where we went to school or what our backgrounds were.\nWe were just a band of brothers who all fought under the same flag, and all prayed to the same God. Today, we're a little bit older, we're a little bit greyer. But we still know how to fight for our country. And what we're fighting for is an America where all of us are truly in the same boat.\nWe‘re not just Democrats or Republicans. We are Americans. We have to end the divisions in this country. We have to work together for the America we can become. We need good education for all our children. We need to protect our environment. We need to strengthen our military and lead strong alliances.\nSo, I ask for your help. Talk to your neighbors; talk to your friends. Enlist in our cause.\nMy friends, this is the most important election of our lifetime. And that's not something I'm telling you. That's something you've told me again and again. And now, the outcome is more in your hands than in mine.\nIn great movements for civil rights and equal rights and the environment, we have come together as one America to give life to our mighty dream.\nSo come together again and stand up for a great purpose – to make America stronger at home and respected in the world.\nWe're a country of the future; we're a country of optimists. We're the can-do people. And we just need to believe in ourselves.\nLet America be America again.\nThank you, and God bless you.", "timestamp": "2004-06-21", "title": "Remarks in Denver, Colorado"}

It's great to be here in San Jose.\nAnd I want to thank Lee Iacocca for that generous introduction and for his powerful endorsement of our plans to build a stronger America. Like FDR, he knows the test of leadership is not whether it's Republican or Democratic, but whether it will move this country forward. I'm proud to have his counsel and his support. You know, there are few men more respected not just in corporate America, but in all of America, than Lee Iacocca.\nHe is living proof of the power of a great American idea пїЅ higher education that's open to all. The son of working class immigrants, he delivered groceries so he could go to Lehigh and then went on to get a masters degree at Princeton. Education was the key to his future.\nAnd he used that knowledge to become one of America's most successful can-do leaders.\nWhen he saw that cars were unaffordable for the average American, he tried the novel idea of asking folks to pay only $56 down, followed by monthly payments. Today that's just business, but in the 1950s it was a breakthrough. One that led to the purchase of 75 million more cars.\nWhen he saw an oil crisis that was sending gas prices through the roof, he came up with the lightweight, front-wheel drive K-car that pulled Chrysler out of its seventies slump.\nAnd when foreign automakers were out-competing Americans in the 1980s, Lee Iacocca sent profits soaring after he introduced a spacious, family vehicle that no other automaker wanted to take a chance on: the minivan.\nThis is a man who took over Chrysler when it was deep in the red, with poor management, outdated products, and sinking sales. And in just a few short years, he turned the company around, bringing record profits, new jobs, new leadership, and a revived reputation. Sounds a little bit like what we're going to do come November, doesn't it?\nLee Iacocca's story is remarkable, but not unique. For the genius of the American people has always driven the story of American progress. We are a country of innovators and optimists. We're the can-do people. Just when it seems we've reached a plateau or come across a problem too difficult to solve, there is someone, somewhere in America who asks \"what if?\" And a discovery is made that transforms our lives. Entire new industries emerge. Not just new jobs, but whole new professions are created. For yet another time, a new economy is born and America is stronger.\nAt the dawn of the 21st century, the possibilities are limitless. But they won't just happen. We have to invest more in our people and their ideas. And America must lead, not follow, other countries in the great discoveries that bring greater prosperity.\nToday Americans are concerned about jobs moving overseas. Nevertheless, we can't build a wall between America and the world; indeed as we create new products, we want to send them and sell them to the rest of the world. But at the same time, there's no reason in the world that American workers should be forced to use their hard earned money to reward a company that moves overseas. We can and must end the tax breaks that force American workers to subsidize the export of their own jobs. It doesn't make sense. Above all, the best way to keep jobs in America is to invest in America пїЅ in the industries that are already generating high-wage jobs and helping us lead higher-quality lives.\nSo today, I'm going to lay out my plan to build an economy for our future. The focus is not just on the next election, but on the next generation. It's a plan to let America be America again by tapping the ingenuity and innovation that are at the heart of our history and our character as a people.\nToday, ideas and commerce move across the globe with greater ease than our grandparents traveled across town. We've gone from computers that won't fit through your door to computers that fit in the palm of your hand пїЅ like the ones my staff play with when my speeches go too long. Information that once filled stacks of library shelves now barely uses up a microchip.\nThis technological revolution is the foundation of a 21st century economy. But it's up to us to build on that foundation so that we can create and expand 21st century jobs. We won't get very far with a government that wants to stifle or ignore the creativity and entrepreneurship that will produce the next big idea: we need to encourage it and invest in it.\nWe won't get very far with a leadership that lets America fall to 10th in the world when it comes to adopting broadband Internet access. We need a leadership that says if Bangalore in India can be completely wired, then so should all of America.\nAnd we won't get very far with a government that starves science and technology and slashes future budgets for research. Imagine if folks thought it wasn't important to fund the small project that led to the creation of the Internet? Imagine if they thought it wasn't important to fund the DNA research that led to biotechnology breakthroughs that today and everyday save thousands of lives?\nLuckily, we don't have to imagine that kind of past. But now we have to choose a future: one where we fall behind because of neglect and hostility at the highest levels of leadership. Or one where America leads the world by ceaselessly investing in new ideas and the creativity of people working to make them real. To have the right kind of future, here specifically is what we have to do:\nFirst, we can create a business environment that will strengthen the American economy and fuel high-tech job growth. We can do this by breaking down the barriers to investing in the most innovative firms. Many of today's technology giants started out as a thought in a graduate student's head and grew out of garages and basements where the spark of an idea ignited a new industry. Start-ups drive technology job creation. They usually have big ideas but small capital and a tough time finding someone to take a chance on them. Yet, over the past 30 years, the venture capital-backed startups have grown our economy and generated over 8 million American jobs.\nWe need to open the floodgates of entrepreneurship and venture capital by eliminating capital gains taxes for new, long-term investments in small businesses. The jobs of tomorrow depend on discoveries today пїЅ so we also need to extend the Research and Development tax credit. We should welcome broad-based stock ownership as a way to help companies grow and give their employees a stake in their success. And we need to cut the federal deficit in half and get Washington's budget in order so small business owners can feel confident planning theirs.\nSecond, we need to seize the possibilities of the Broadband Revolution and make Internet access available to all of America's families. We need to make sure we don't settle for slipping to 10th place in the world when it comes to adopting Broadband. This means connecting every corner of our country to a network that's up to 100 times faster than today's. Installing this network can grow our economy by $500 billion and bring us 1.2 million new, high-wage jobs.\nTo make it happen, we will offer tax incentives to extend broadband access to rural areas and inner-cities. We will expand the available spectrum to make more room for broadband wireless services and advanced WiMAX services. And after more and more households transfer to digital television, we will sell spectrum space to private companies and use the money to invest in science and technology and pay for every dime of the plan I am discussing today.\nBut expanding broadband access is about more than just making sure every American can call up their favorite website, like www.johnkerry.com. It's about a little boy in Detroit or a little girl from rural Florida who can access the same research for their science project as a child from the wealthiest suburb in the country. It's about a grandmother from the plains of Iowa who can't walk too well but is able to order her groceries and her medicine online.\nAnd it's about providing our first responders with a secure, wireless network that will arm them with the best communications network so they can better protect America. I want to ensure that every first responder in the country has broadband by the end of 2006. I want them to be part of a wireless network that can detect the first whiff of danger from a chemical plant and instantaneously alert every official in the city. A network that will pinpoint the location of co-worker who's trapped under rubble. A network that will allow hospitals to prepare for incoming patients by watching streaming video feeds live from the ambulance. For the safety and security of the American people, this is a network we need in every single city in America, and when I am President, that is a network we will build.\nIn the last century, across a continent that stretched from sea to shining sea, there were entire islands of darkness. The Rural Electric Administration changed that. Today, visionary national leadership can build a bridge across the digital divide and bring the promise of broadband technology to every home in America.\nAnd as we work to expand the broadband breakthrough today, we need to invest in the breakthroughs of the next decade. That's why the third part of my plan focuses on research that will feed the innovations and industries of the future.\nToday, amazing discoveries are being made in America.\nAt New Mexico's Sandia National Laboratories, a biosensor is being developed that will allow us to check cargo coming into our ports for deadly biological agents before the container is ever opened.\nAt Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University, researchers have developed a virtual algebra tutor that has helped inner-city kids in under-served schools raise their scores an entire letter grade.\nAnd recently in rural Virginia, telemedicine allowed a cardiologist 75 miles from the hospital to view an ultrasound and diagnose a congenital heart defect that required immediate medication, saving a young child's life.\nEverywhere we turn, our country's best and brightest are discovering new ways to improve the lives of their fellow Americans. Their passion is science; their cause is discovery; their gift to us is a stronger America. Some say we cannot afford to fund their curiosity. I say, \"how can we afford not to?\"\nIf I am President, we will invest more in areas of research that are likely to create the industries and jobs of the future -- areas like advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and nanotechnology that have the potential to improve lives and save them. And because we do not know where the next great breakthrough will come from, I will support the curiosity-driven, high-risk research that has given us such \"accidental\" discoveries as the MRI.\nFinally, I will be a President for science who listens to the advice of scientists so I can make the best decisions. Their reports and evaluations will be open so that you can make informed decisions as well. This is your future and I will let science guide us, not ideology. And to encourage the scientists of tomorrow, we will work to improve our children's math and science education and expand America's science and engineering workforce.\nIt is time for an America stronger in science to lead the world in a 21st century age of discovery. This is an aspiration as new as the next innovation and as old as the American Constitution, which tells us that America is America when we \"promote the progress of science and useful arts.\"\nAnd for centuries, our Presidents have done just that. From George Washington's patent system to Franklin Roosevelt's great national laboratories. Dwight Eisenhower expanded science education in our schools. John Kennedy set our sights on the moon while Bill Clinton helped lead us to a map of the entire human genome.\nAbraham Lincoln, who opened the National Academy of Sciences, said that part of government's mission is to add \"the fuel of interest to the fire of genius in the discovery of new and useful things.\"\nThis nation is destined to think big and dream big. And it's time America had a President who once again will look toward a future of discovery with hope and confidence.\nToday, I've offered an economic agenda focused on high-tech, high-wage job growth. It is an optimistic agenda for prosperity. It recognizes that the promise of the Information Age was not a bubble; it is a breakthrough that will continue to lift our economy and our lives.\nAnd if America is willing to provide the fuel, then the fires of genius will continue to light our way. We just need to believe in ourselves пїЅ and in opening up the paths of progress, America will be America again.", "timestamp": "2004-06-24", "title": "Remarks in San Jose, California"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29703", "text": "I want to thank all of you for coming today. It's wonderful to be back at NALEO. Last year, we met in Arizona. This year, we're in Washington. We're clearly headed in the right direction. With your help, next year we'll have a new place to meet just a few blocks from here.\nLast summer, when we met, the primaries were just heating up. Since things turned out so well, I've decided that coming here must've been a good idea. So I'm going to keep coming back. Because together we can take back the White House – and put more of you in elected offices all across America.\nI want to thank you for the work you're doing every day to build a stronger America. Hispanics may be the fastest growing group in our country, but you've always held on to your basic values – values that built America: strong families, deep faith, and closely-knit communities. You have never forgotten what Cesar Chavez once said, \"We cannot seek achievement for ourselves and forget about progress and prosperity for our community.\" From the boardroom to the barrio, you embody the American ideal – out of many, we are one. And as you have shown us, now, more than ever, we must stand as one America.\nToday, thanks to you, we are one step closer to an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world. And that's what I want to talk about this morning: how together we can create opportunity for Hispanics here at home and build stronger relationships with Latin America.\nWe're here to fight for good-paying jobs that let American workers actually get ahead.\nWe're here to make health care a right for all of our people.\nWe're here to make this nation energy independent.\nAnd we're here to build a strong military, and lead strong alliances, so that our military is never overextended and young Americans are never put in harm's way because we went it alone.\nYou know, I was born in an Army hospital in Denver, Colorado when my father was a pilot in World War II. My father and my mother taught me the value of service.\nI've always been determined to give something back to my country – as a soldier, as a prosecutor, as a Senator. And now, I'm running for President. It's been a great adventure and a great privilege. So many of you have welcomed Teresa and me into your homes and hearts. You have told us the stories of your lives – and they have become the work of my life.\nThe poet Langston Hughes told the stories in this way: \"Let America be America again. Let it be the dream it used to be\" – for those \"whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain, whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain must bring back our mighty dream again.\"\nIn 2004, we have to bring back our mighty dream again. We have to make America all that it can become.\nYou know, working families all across our country are living by the oldest and greatest of American values – hard work, service, and caring for one another.\nAnd I'm running for president because I believe that our government should live by those values, too.\nIt's time to remember a basic truth: a stronger America begins right here at home.\nIn the last three years, Hispanic American unemployment has soared more than 30 percent. 1.4 million Hispanic Americans are out of work. And those finally getting jobs, are being paid an average of $9000 less a year.\nBut, as you know better than anybody, as wages are going down, Latino health care costs are going up; tuitions are going up; bills are going up. So, more and more Latinos are working weekends; some of them are working two jobs, three jobs – and they're still not getting ahead.\nAnd to add insult to injury, their hard-earned tax dollars are actually paying corporations to export good American jobs.\nTwenty years ago, middle class families with one parent working used to be able to buy a home and pay for college. But today, two incomes barely cover the basics.\nAnd, as you know too well, if anything at all goes wrong – an illness or a temporary layoff – most families can't pay the bills and they risk losing everything they've built and saved for.\nIn America, a rising tide is supposed to lift all boats. But today, the middle class boat is taking on water. Like most Americans, I believe we can do better than 1.9 million lost private sector jobs, rising costs, and shrinking incomes. I believe in the American economy and American workers.\nWe all know that the middle class built this country. Franklin Roosevelt understood that. And so did Bill Clinton. But for nearly four years now, Washington has ignored the middle class, putting wealth ahead of work, something-for-nothing ahead of responsibility, and what's right for the few ahead of what's right for America.\nI believe in building up our great middle class – especially the millions of Hispanic Americans coming into the middle class – respecting their work, honoring their values, and lifting them up in the toughest of times. I'm running for president because I want an economy that strengthens and expands the middle class, not one that squeezes it.\nWe're going to cut taxes for the middle class. And we're going to rollback the Bush tax cuts for those who make over $200,000 a year, invest in education, in health care, and we're going to cut the deficit in half.\nI want middle class taxes to go down, so your incomes go up.\nLet me tell you, we need a president who fights for your job as hard as he fights for his own.\nI have a plan to put good paying jobs at the heart of our economy. And when I'm president, American taxpayers will never again subsidize the loss of their own jobs.\nWe're going to close tax loopholes that pay companies to move our jobs overseas – and we're going to reward companies that create good jobs here in America.\nMy plan calls for tough enforcement of our trade agreements. We're gonna stop other countries from violating those agreements and walking away with the store. Because I'll tell you what I've seen traveling across this country, if you give American workers a fair playing field, there's no one in the world that the American worker can't compete against.\nTrade with our neighbors will make us all stronger. But trade without respect is not what our neighbors want – and neither is one-note insistence on free trade agreements. We need to lift up living standards and working conditions for all working men and women in the US and around the world. As president, I will fight for labor and environment protections in every single trade agreement.\nI will also work to strengthen our economic and political ties with our neighbors in Latin America, the Caribbean and Canada. I will bring us back to the negotiating table to develop a Central American Free Trade Agreement that provides economic benefits, creates jobs and includes strong protections for labor and the environment. And I will do the same in our negotiations for the Free Trade Area of the Americas.\nLet America be America again.\nBeing strong at home means extending educational opportunity to every child in America, wherever they live, wherever their parents came from. We need to make sure there is a great teacher in every classroom, especially in our hardest pressed communities, and especially for kids who are learning English in our schools. And through programs like GEAR UP and TRIO, we need to reach out to our children and send them a clear message: if you work hard, if you stick with it, not only will you finish high school, but we will make sure you can afford college, graduate, live the American Dream.\nAnd being strong at home means health care that is affordable and accessible to all Americans.\nRight now, there are millions of Americans – including one out of every three Latinos – who go to bed every night without basic health care. And I've met scores of them. Families with names like Gutierrez, Garcia, and Martinez.\nI'm running for President because I believe their family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, DC.\nLet me just ask you:\nHave your health insurance premiums gone up in the last few years?\nHave your co-payments gone up?\nHave your deductibles gone up?\nThen you need to tell this Administration we're fed up and their time is up.\nFor almost four years, they've had no plan, while rising health care costs are hurting families and making it harder and harder for businesses to compete. My plan will take on the waste and greed in the health care system. It will reduce the average premium by $1,000 a year. It will expand coverage to 95 percent of Americans, including 99 percent of our kids. And, it will crack down on skyrocketing drug prices.\nThis Administration has it absolutely backwards. They say it's alright to export American jobs. Well, I say it's only right to let Americans import prescription drugs from Canada.\nThey say we should give billions more to big drug companies. I say we should give seniors a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare.\nAnd in a Kerry Administration, we will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the elected and the connected or the wealthy – it is a right for every American – so let America be America again.\nAnd being strong at home means always remembering that we are a nation of immigrants. America wouldn't be where it is today – as a country and as a people – if it weren't for immigrants. And neither would I – because I married one! My wife Teresa was raised under a dictatorship in Mozambique. She didn't get to cast a vote in America until she was [24]. But I can tell you, as much as she loves her roots and loves her heritage, I have met few people who love America as much as she does. Teresa is not alone. From soldiers to students, there are thousands of immigrants who have come to our shores and made America a better place.\nEvery year, hundreds seeking only a better life die in the desert. Millions labor in the shadows of our country, in fear and often abused. This does not serve our economy or our security. It doesn't reflect our values as a country built by immigrants.\nIt is time to fulfill the promise of America, so that those who work hard and take responsibility can build a better life for themselves and their families. Good people who are living here, working hard and paying taxes should have a path to equal citizenship in the American community. And families should be reunited more quickly. Our worker visa system should be fixed so it protects the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers and temporary workers. And as we do all this, we should improve our border security, fix our watch lists, and make Mexico a real partner, so that our country is safe from those who'd harm us.\nA stronger America is also one that's respected in the world. But we will never be respected, unless, as Franklin Roosevelt once said, we are a good neighbor \"who resolutely respects ... the rights of others.\"\nOf course, Roosevelt was speaking of Latin America, and the message he sent has influenced every administration, from Kennedy to Clinton. They understood that a strong Latin America is key to a strong America.\nThe 1990s were particularly good for Latin America and US-Latin American relations. There was an almost universal embrace of democracy and institutional reform -- and Latin America edged ever closer to first-world economies and values. And that was good for the United States. What happens in this hemisphere has a profound effect on Main Street, USA – from our jobs to healthcare, from immigration to schools. In the Americas, foreign policy and domestic policy blur into one. It's fair to say that nearly every corner of the United States feels the effects of our relations with our neighbors.\nThat's why it's been such a disappointment that this Administration has forgotten Roosevelt's good advice. Instead of being a good neighbor, the president has ignored a wide range of ills – including political and financial crises, runaway unemployment, and drug trafficking. And his one-note policy toward Latin America of one-size-fits all trade agreements have stripped the respect and partnership that marked the Clinton years.\nIn 1994, President Clinton convened the Summit of the Americas – the first summit in a quarter-century. As president, I will build on that spirit and help forge a new and broader \"Community of the Americas.\" A community where neighbors look after neighbors, recognizing that we all have a stake in each other's future.\nAt the core of this Community of the Americas will be the bottom-line defense of democracy and the rule of law. While democracy has moved forward in countries like Mexico, Brazil, and Chile, we can't sit by and watch as mob violence drives a president from office, like what happened in Bolivia or Argentina -- or even encourage him to flee, as we did in Haiti. We will not welcome a government named by a military junta, as was the case in Venezuela. Strong democratic states with transparent rules and a broad respect for the rule of law are essential to alleviating poverty and inequality in the region. As president, I will strongly support democratic institutions, assist democracy where it is troubled, and promote democracy in Cuba.\nI will create a Council for Democracy with distinguished international leaders who can work with the Organization of American States to resolve crises before order is threatened and blood is shed. I will also triple funding for the National Endowment for Democracy's programs that strengthen democracy in Latin America. And I will support the Social Investment and Development Fund for the Americas. This $500 million fund will promote public and private partnerships in the region, and give training and developmental assistance to startup companies.\nI will also create a \"North American Security Perimeter\" to better facilitate the legitimate travel of law-abiding citizens and crack down on bad actors trying to enter the United States. By working closely with our border neighbors to coordinate our customs, immigration and law enforcement policies, we can better protect the region from terrorist threats.\nFinally, we are also losing the hearts and minds of a generation of leaders in Latin America by making it harder for young people to get visas to study here. As President, I will triple the number of educational exchanges, and encourage colleges to give tuition waivers to foreign students in exchange for internships overseas for our students.\nThe Community of Americas is about working together toward shared goals. In the war on terror, in the war on poverty, in the war on drug smuggling, in our many common battles, we must look to our neighbors as partners, not as second-class citizens, so this can truly be the Century of the Americas.\nWhen I was in Vietnam, I served on a small boat on the Mekong Delta with men who came from places as diverse as South Carolina and Iowa ... Arkansas and California.\nWe were literally all in the same boat – and we came together as one. No one asked us our politics. No one cared where we went to school or what our backgrounds were.\nWe were just a band of brothers who all fought under the same flag, and all prayed to the same God. Today, we're a little bit older, we're a little bit greyer. But we still know how to fight for our country. And what we're fighting for is an America where all of us are truly in the same boat.\nWe're not just Democrats or Republicans. We are Americans. We have to end the divisions in this country. We have to work together for the America we can become.\nSo, I ask for your help. Talk to your neighbors; talk to your friends. Enlist in our cause.\nMy friends, this is the most important election of our lifetime. And that's not something I'm telling you. That's something Americans have told me again and again.\nIn great movements for civil rights and equal rights and the environment, we have come together as one America to give life to our mighty dream.\nSo come together again and stand up for a great purpose – to make America stronger at home and respected in the world.\nWe're a country of the future; we're a country of optimists. We're the can-do people. And no one understands that more than America's Latinos. People who've come here to work hard, pay taxes, and raise their children. No one has a bigger stake in America's future. We just need to believe in ourselves.\nQue America sea America. Para Todos.\nLet America be America again.\nSi se puede! Si se puede! Si se puede!\nThank you, and God bless you.", "timestamp": "2004-06-26", "title": "Remarks to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Washington, DC"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29704", "text": "Forty years ago this week – a decade after the Supreme Court declared separate inherently unequal and Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat – the Congress passed and the President signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nThe bill was signed at the White House, but as Dr. Martin Luther King understood, in truth, it \"was ... written in the streets\" of America. It was written by the foot soldiers in the sweltering heat of Birmingham and in cities and towns all across the South. It was written by freedom fighters, who climbed aboard buses and marched into the blast of a fire hose and the bark of a dog, without ever resorting to violence. And it was written by men and women like Reverend Jesse Jackson and Dorothy Height, who put their minds and their bodies into the crucible of hatred, so we would all see a better day.\nThe Civil Rights Act was rooted in the fundamental ideal that all people are created equal – no matter what our race, sex, religion, or national origin. We are all deserving of an equal shot at the American dream – at a good job, a good education, and the right to drink from the same fountain of opportunity.\nI'm here this morning to talk to you about that dream and about the opportunity that Reverend Jackson called, a \"new vision and new possibilities ... [for a] revival of the [human] spirit.\"\nBecause as Dr. King told us, the Civil Rights Act was \"only the beginning of a new day ... not the end of a journey.\" Our journey for equal opportunity in America is far from over. The Civil Rights Act is still being written by the work you do every day. We must \"lift it up from thin paper\" and put it into \"thick action.\"\nThat's exactly what Rainbow Push does. Your Wall Street Project invests in new markets in the hardest-pressed communities. Your work with American labor is helping to build an economy that lifts up all our families. And your Reinvest in America project is helping put all of America – beginning with Appalachia – back to work. And as everyone who knows Reverend Jackson can tell you, there's no rest for the weary.\nMy friends, we can't rest until all Americans, black and white, rich and poor, people of all colors and all backgrounds, truly have the opportunity they need to make the American dream real.\nSo we are here today in common purpose. We're here to fight for good paying jobs that let American families actually get ahead. We're here to make health care affordable for all of our people. We're here to make this nation energy independent.\nWe're here to build a strong military, and lead strong alliances, so that America will be safer and more respected, and that young Americans will never be put in harm's way because we insisted on going it alone.\nAnd we're here to ensure that the young men and women who put their lives on the line for us overseas, come home to an America they can be proud of – with good paying jobs, good education, and affordable health care.\nDuring this campaign, you have welcomed Teresa and me into your hearts and you're your homes. We have heard your stories of hope and struggle. The stories of your lives have become the work of my life. I am running for President to be part of making your dreams real again. To fight with you in your struggles.\nThe poet Langston Hughes put it this way: \"Let America be America again. Let it be the dream it used to be\"  – for those \"whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain, whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain must bring back our mighty dream again.\"\nIn 2004, we have to bring back our mighty dream again. We have to make America all that it can become.\nThis Administration says this is the best economy of our lifetime. They say this is the best we can do. They've even called us pessimists. Well, I say, the most pessimistic thing you can say is that we can't do better.\nDon't tell us two million lost jobs is the best we can do, when we can create millions of new jobs. We can do better and we will.\nDon't tell us overcrowded schools and underpaid teachers are the best we can do. We have the means to give all our children a first-rate education. We can do better. And we will.\nDon't tell us $2 a gallon at the tank is the best we can do. We have the technology to make us energy independent of Mideast oil. We can do better. And we will.\nDon't tell us it's the best we can do when in the last election two million votes weren't counted. We live in the greatest democracy in the world. We must make sure every vote is counted and every vote counts. We can do better. And we will.\nI believe in an America that is stronger at home and respected around the world. And it's time to remember a basic truth: opportunity begins at home.\nMore than a million Americans who were working three years ago have lost their jobs. African-American unemployment is now at 10 percent – double the rate for whites. And the new jobs finally being created pay an average of $9,000 less a year. But, as wages are going down, your health care costs are going up; your tuitions are going up; your bills are going up.\nI have a plan to put and keep good paying jobs at the heart of our economy. How many of you know that your hard-earned tax money is being used to ship your jobs overseas. It is inexcusable. And when I'm President, American taxpayers will never again subsidize the loss of their own jobs. We're going to close tax loopholes that pay companies to move our jobs overseas – and we're going to reward companies that create good jobs here in America.\nMy plan calls for tough enforcement of our trade agreements. We're gonna stop other countries from violating those agreements and walking away with the store. And we're gonna fight for labor and environment protections in every single trade agreement. Because I'll tell you what I've seen traveling across this country, if you give American workers a level playing field, there's no one in the world that the American worker can't compete against. And there's one other thing I want to say about a level playing field: the right to organize is a basic right and it ought to be protected and honored in this country.\nIf we want America to thrive and succeed in the long-run, we have to look beyond today. We have to create an opportunity economy for tomorrow. We must invest in our human capital, so America has the best trained, best educated workforce in the world.\nSince our nation was founded, the number one engine of America's growth has been the mind and might of our people. That's something Horace Mann realized more than a hundred sixty years ago, when he demanded free and universal education for all of our children. He knew that our economy would always grow if our citizens grew with it.\nBy the end of the 19th century, every single child in the United States got an elementary school education – and soon, universal high school education was the norm. As Mann had predicted, the economy shot right up with the knowledge they received. Between 1880 and 1920, the American economy soared, growing more than 300 percent – ushering in what we know as the \"American Century.\"\nIn 1944, Franklin D. Roosevelt transformed America once again, when he opened the doors of college to millions of veterans returning from World War II. The GI Bill prepared America for the great post-war boom, training half a million new engineers, scientists, and physicians.\nIn today's global economy, more jobs require higher levels of skills, and the demand is only getting greater. And with advances in technology, the world is getting smaller. Today, workers in Illinois aren't just competing against workers in Michigan or Ohio; they're competing against workers in India and Indonesia. And they're all competing for high-skilled jobs. If America wants to win, if we want to succeed in the 21st century marketplace, our workers need a 21st century education.\nBut the truth is, we've fallen behind in the race. At a time when college is more important than ever, too many Americans can't afford to go. And too many of those who are going to college aren't finishing. In an era when college graduates will earn $900,000 more than high school graduates over the course of a career, less than a third of all Americans have a four year college degree – and less than a fifth of all African Americans do. If that's not an argument for expanding college education, then I don't know what is.\nOn top of that, we're falling behind our competitors in math and science, the building blocks for the jobs of tomorrow. Studies show that only a third of American students are proficient in math and science – and the figure is even lower for women and minorities. In fact, our colleges are only graduating 60,000 engineers a year – one tenth the number that India and China graduate. As Andy Grove, the CEO of Intel, puts it: \"[our] scientific and technical education has reached an emergency [level].\" We're not just falling behind in the race for high skill jobs; we're barely making it to the starting line.\nWe must move toward the day when four years of college is as universal and affordable as a high school education is today. To meet the economic challenge of the future, we need to make sure all Americans – no matter what they do – have the skills to adapt and succeed in their careers.\nWe need an education revolution, a GI Bill for the new century, and the next economy.\nHere's how we'll do it.\nFirst, we need to help young people afford the college education that's so important to their future. My College Opportunity Tax Credit will make four years of college universally accessible, with a credit on up to $4,000 of tuition for four years of college. And unlike most tax credits, students will be able to get this one in advance, so they can actually pay their tuition when the bill comes.\nWe also need to hold down the costs at colleges and universities that are sending out the bill. In the last three years, college tuition has shot up 35 percent, five times faster than the cost of living. It's no wonder students can't afford college. And if you don't think rising tuition costs are squeezing America's families, then you should spend some time – as I have – talking to working families trying to put their kids through school. As President, I will help keep college costs down by making a new deal with states. We will offer states $10 billion to invest in their public colleges and universities. But they will only get their share if they hold tuitions in line with inflation.\nSecond, we will make sure those who go to school, stay in school, and leave with a degree. Too many young people graduate from high school without the skills they need for college. Too many colleges focus on getting kids to sign up, but don't stick with them so they can make it through. That's especially true with minorities. Right now, almost 50 percent of college freshmen don't graduate, and more than 60 percent of minorities never wear a cap and gown. An acceptance letter won't land you a high-skilled job, but a good education will. And that begins in high school, where studies show that a rigorous curriculum is the best preparation to succeed.\nAs President, I will work with states to strengthen their high school curriculum, so that every child leaves high school ready for college. We will also create a College Completion Fund that will reward schools for the number of underprivileged students they graduate. And we will fund programs, like pre-college academic boot camps and intensive mentoring, that help students from the day they set foot on campus to the day they graduate – so that no one falls through the cracks.\nThird, we will close the math-science gap that threatens both our standard of living and the future strength of our economy. When the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satellite, America invested in a new generation of scientists and engineers, whose innovation paved the way for the information economy. But in the last 30 years, the US has fallen from third in the world to fifteenth in the number of new scientists and engineers in our workforce. And women and minorities, in particular, are choosing other careers. Women make up only 10 percent of engineers – and only fifteen blacks and eight Hispanic Americans received PhDs in computer science a year. That's a brain drain we can't afford in this global era. But it's one we can fix.\nEarly on, too many kids are steered away from math and science – by their teachers, by their parents, or their friends. Too many are told they're not good at it or that it's not the cool thing to do.\nIn fact, surveys show that in fourth grade, girls and boys are equally interested in math and science. But by eighth grade, twice as many boys want to go into math and science careers.\nAs President, I'll give all Americans, especially women and minorities, that same encouragement. And we have to give it early on. We're going to pay math and science teachers better and then train them better, partnering high school teachers with scientists and colleges. To get girls and minorities engaged in math and science, we will fund special programs in middle school and high school. Programs like Rainbow PUSH's Digital Village in East Palo Alto which has organized internships at Silicon Valley companies for disadvantaged students. And the program in Philadelphia that teaches girls who are athletes about the science behind their sports.\nAnd its time we make a major effort to address the subtle discrimination and low expectations that cause too many young women to believe that math and science is somehow not for them. As President, I will support all-girls' schools designed specifically to prepare girls for careers in science and math. Here in Chicago, one of the most promising of these schools is the Young Women's Leadership Charter School. 85 percent of the graduates are minorities; 65 percent come from low-income families; and more than 40 percent of those who graduated now plan to major in math, science, or engineering in college.\nFinally, in our high-skill economy, we have to remember that today, high school and college are just the first steps in a lifetime of learning. More and more Americans change jobs as the economy changes. It's hard to believe, but a decade from now, many of our workers will hold jobs in industries that don't even exist today. The key to success not just in this economy, but in the next one, is to give them new learning every step along the way.\nIf we are serious about lifetime learning, we have to be serious about helping young people just entering the workforce and parents balancing work and family – so they can find the time for more education. And we have to get away from the old notion that education and training are only for those who lose their job – not those who are trying to keep it or get a better one. As President, I'll make it far easier for working Americans to get the new skills and new training they need. We will invest in state of the art on-line courses, so that people can get the highest-quality instruction right at their kitchen table. We will also change our outdated financial aid rules, so that distance learners can get the same assistance as traditional students. And we'll build new partnerships between businesses and community colleges to improve technical training and offer apprenticeships in cutting-edge fields.\nSuccess in this economy – and the next – is a two way street. We need to secure the best possible education for all Americans. But it's up to each American to make the most of it.\nWhen I was in Vietnam, I served on a small boat on the Mekong Delta with men who came from places as diverse as South Carolina and Iowa ... Arkansas and California. We were literally all in the same boat – and we came together as one. No one asked us our politics. No one cared where we went to school or what our race or backgrounds were. We were just a band of brothers who all fought under the same flag, and all prayed to the same God.\nToday, we're a little bit older, we're a little bit greyer. But we still know how to fight for our country. And what we're fighting for is an America where all of us are truly in the same boat.\nIn great movements for civil rights and equal rights and the environment, we have come together as one America to give life to our mighty dream. So come together again and stand up for a great purpose – to make America stronger at home and respected in the world. We're a country of the future; we're a country of optimists. We're the can-do people. And we just need to believe in ourselves.\nLet America be America again. Thank you, and God bless you.", "timestamp": "2004-06-29", "title": "Remarks to the 33rd Annual Rainbow / PUSH Coalition and Citizenship Education Fund Conference"}

Thank you to Governor Napolitano, Antonio Villaraigosa, Congressman Ed Pastor and all the distinguished members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who are here.\nThank you also to Raul Yzaguirre for your years of service and strong leadership here at National Council La Raza.\nAnd today, I'm proud to announce that Jose Villarreal, who has brought vision and strength to this council and this nation, will bring leadership to our campaign as one of our national co-chairs.\nForty years ago this week, we passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And while President Lyndon Johnson may have signed that law with one pen, that chapter in our American story was written by millions of everyday patriots who were willing to stand up and speak out.\nAs Dr. Martin Luther King understood, it \"was ... written in the streets\" of America. It was written by the foot soldiers in the sweltering heat of Birmingham and in cities and towns all across the South. And in the years to come, countless pages would be added to this chapter by courageous Americans who sought to expand equal opportunity to all.\nCesar Chavez added a page in 1968 when he fasted for twenty-five days to promote equal opportunity for the workers in California's San Joaquin Valley and beyond. And when he ended the hunger strike by breaking bread with Robert Kennedy at mass, he reminded America that while we may differ, in the end we are a \"family bound together in a common struggle for justice.\"\nThat is the enduring struggle of those who still celebrate The Civil Rights Act today, and of all Americans who want to see the promise of opportunity reach every family in every city and town across America.\nI'm here this afternoon to talk to you about what our American family can do to make this a reality. And I want to start by thanking you for the work you're doing every day to build a stronger America. Hispanics are the fastest growing group in our country, but even as you have made the American culture your own, you've always held on to your basic values -- values that built America: strong families, deep faith, and closely-knit communities. You embody the American ideal -- out of many, we are one. And as you have shown us, now, more than ever, we must stand as one America.\nToday, thanks to you, we are one step closer to an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world. But we have a long way to go. And that's what brings us here today.\nWe're here to fight for good-paying jobs that let American workers actually get ahead.\nWe're here to make health care a right for all of our people.\nWe're here to make this nation energy independent.\nAnd we're here to build a strong military, and lead strong alliances, so that our military is never overextended and young Americans are never put in harm's way because in our arrogance we insisted on going it alone.\nYou know, I was born in an Army hospital in Denver, Colorado when my father was a pilot in World War II. My father continued to serve all his life, and my mother was a community activist all of hers. From them, I learned the value of service. My family taught me what it means to love your country and work to make it stronger.\nI've always been determined to give something back to my country – as a soldier, as a prosecutor, as a Senator. And now, I'm running for President. It's been a great adventure and a great privilege. So many of you have welcomed Teresa and me into your homes and hearts. You have told us the stories of your lives – and they have become the work of my life.\nAnd what you've shown me is that working families all across our country are living by the oldest and greatest of American values – hard work, service, and caring for one another.\nI'm running for president because I believe that the America people are owed a government lives by those values, too.\nIt's time to remember a basic truth: a stronger America begins right here at home.\nIn the last three years, Hispanic American unemployment has soared more than 30 percent. 1.4 million Hispanic Americans are out of work. Those finally getting jobs are being paid an average of $9000 less a year. And millions and millions of hardworking Hispanics who have jobs aren't getting paid enough to pay the bills.\nBut, as you know better than anybody, as wages are going down, your health care costs are going up; tuitions are going up; bills are going up. So, more and more of you are working weekends; some of you are working two jobs, three jobs – and you're still not getting ahead.\nTwenty years ago, middle class families with one parent working used to be able to buy a home and pay for college. But today, two incomes barely cover the basics.\nWell I believe in building up our great middle class – especially the millions of Hispanic Americans who are working hard and still struggling to join that middle class. We need to make sure they have the opportunity to work in jobs that help them get ahead. We need to respect their work, honor their values, and lift them up in the toughest of times. I'm running for president because I want an economy that strengthens and expands the middle class, not one that squeezes it. I want an America where Americans aren't just working and working for the economy, but the economy is working for all Americans.\nWe're going to cut taxes for the middle class. And we're going to rollback the Bush tax cuts for those who make over $200,000 a year, invest in education, in health care, and we're going to cut the deficit in half.\nIt's time for middle class taxes to go down, so your incomes go up.\nAnd it's time to make sure we offer all Americans the chance not just to make ends meet, but to make a better life. No group in America is more likely than Hispanics to work full-time, year-round – and still live in poverty. That is why we need to raise the minimum wage – to promote a living wage - and to expand labor rights on the job.\nLet me tell you, we need a president who fights for your job as hard as he fights for his own.\nI have a plan to put good paying jobs at the heart of our economy. How many of you know that right now your hard earned tax dollars are being used to reward companies that ship your jobs in Phoenix overseas? That is inexcusable. And when I'm President, American taxpayers will never again subsidize the loss of their own jobs.\nWe're going to close tax loopholes that pay companies to move our jobs overseas – and we're going to reward companies that create good jobs here in America.\nBeing strong at home means extending educational opportunity to every child in America, wherever they live, wherever their parents came from.\nYou know, when I was a prosecutor I met scores of young people – teenagers in trouble – and they all had one thing in common. They came from backgrounds of neglect, abuse, poverty, or hopelessness. We have to stop being an America content to spend 50 to 70 thousand dollars a year to send a kid to prison for life when we can spend 10 to 11 thousand dollars a year on programs like Head Start, Early Start and Youth Build. We can do better than dilapidated schools and double digit drop out rates in our communities...and we will.\nWe need to make sure there is a great teacher in every classroom, especially in our hardest pressed communities, and especially for kids who are learning English in our schools. And through programs like GEAR UP and TRIO, we need to reach out to our children and send them a clear message: if you work hard, if you stick with it, not only will you finish high school, but we will make sure you can afford college, graduate, and live the American Dream. Young people who came to this country and worked hard deserve the chance to go to college – and that's why I will sign the DREAM Act.\nEarlier today, I spoke about my plan to make higher education a reality for young Americans. As President, I will work toward the day when four years of college is as universal and affordable as a high school education is today. And we will do more to ensure that those who start school, finish it. We will also see to it that more students – especially women and minorities -- focus on math and science. And we will invest in a lifetime of learning for all Americans, whether that's technical training or another degree.\nAnd being strong at home means health care that is affordable and accessible to all Americans.\nRight now, there are millions of Americans who go to bed every night without basic health care. Nearly one out of every four Hispanic children is without health insurance and one out of every three Hispanic Americans is uninsured today.\nI'm running for President because I believe your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, DC.\nFor almost four years, they've had no plan, while rising health care costs are hurting families and making it harder and harder for businesses to compete. Under my health care plan, we will cover every child in America and ninety five percent of adults. My plan will take on the waste and greed in the health care system. It will reduce the average premium by $1,000 a year. And, it will crack down on skyrocketing drug prices. We also need to break down the cultural and administrative barriers to signing up for health care and getting the services you need.\nAnd in a Kerry Administration, we will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the elected and the connected or the wealthy – it is a right for every American – so let America be America again.\nAnd being strong at home means always remembering that we are a nation of immigrants. I am committed to celebrating immigration. In fact, I am so committed to this that I am traveling the length and breadth of this nation to make my favorite immigrant the next First Lady of the United States.\nMy wife, Teresa came from a dictatorship. She didn't get to cast a vote until she was 31 when she became a naturalized American. But I can tell you, as much as she loves her roots and loves her heritage, I have met few people who love America as much as she does. Teresa is not alone. From soldiers to students, there are thousands of immigrants who have come to our shores and made America a better place.\nToday, our immigration system is broken. Hundreds of people seeking only a better life for their children die terrible deaths in the desert, often at the hands of cruel smugglers. Millions live in the shadows of our country, frightened and often abused. It is time to fulfill the promise of America, so that those who work hard and take responsibility can build a better life for themselves and their families.\nAnd in my first hundred days as President, I will send a comprehensive immigration reform bill to Congress. It will ensure that good people who are undocumented but are living here, working hard, and paying taxes have a path to equal citizenship in the American community. It will extend English and civics classes so these folks can assume the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. We'll make sure families are reunited more quickly – husbands and wives, sons and daughters. We'll fix our worker visa system so it protects the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers and temporary workers. And as we do all this, we will improve our border security, fix our watch lists, and make Mexico a real partner, so that our country is safe from those who'd harm us. America's relationship with Mexico is critical to our security, and this issue is critical to Mexico.\nTogether, we can do this. Right now, in the Senate, there's a bill with 62 cosponsors. It's part of Cesar Chavez's vision of justice – offering a piece of the American Dream to the good people who labor day after day in the hot sun so Americans can enjoy apples and grapes fresh every day. This President hasn't said if he'll sign that bill. I will, in a heartbeat.\nThese are the kind of the opportunities we can offer if we win this election, and this is the kind of America we can become.\nLast year when I spoke to La Raza, I met a young man named Eric Alva. Shortly after he graduated from high school, Eric walked into a Marine recruiting station in his hometown of San Antonio. He was five foot one and weighed ninety pounds. The recruiters told him the minimum weight requirement was 102 pounds. But Eric was determined. His father had served in the Army in Vietnam – and Eric wanted to do his part for his country. He worked out – and ate some COMIDA TIPICA– and was able to join the Marines. He became a leader. And he returned from Iraq a hero – a recipient of the Purple Heart.\nHispanic Americans repelled Pickett's Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg, fought in Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders, stormed the beaches of Normandy. And I served with so many Latinos in Vietnam. Eric Alva represents the newest chapter in that tradition of service: he did his duty when his country called. And now we have a duty to him – to keep the promise of a society equal to his bravery, an American of opportunity for all.\nWhen I was in Vietnam, I served on a small boat on the Mekong Delta with men who came from places as diverse as South Carolina and Iowa ... Arkansas and California.\nWe were literally all in the same boat – and we came together as one. No one asked us our politics. No one cared where we went to school, what our race was, or what our backgrounds were.\nWe were just a band of brothers who all fought under the same flag, and all prayed to the same God. Today, we're a little bit older, we're a little bit greyer. But we still know how to fight for our country. And what we're fighting for is an America where all of us are truly in the same boat.\nWe‘re not just Democrats or Republicans. We are Americans. We have to end the divisions in this country. We have to work together for the America we can become.\nSo, I ask for your help. Talk to your neighbors; talk to your friends. Enlist in our cause.\nMy friends, this is the most important election of our lifetime. And that's not something I'm telling you. That's something you've told me again and again. And now, the outcome is more in your hands than in mine.\nIn great movements for civil rights and equal rights and the environment, we have come together as one America to give life to our mighty dream.\nSo come together again and stand up for a great purpose – to make America stronger at home and respected in the world.\nWe're a country of the future; we're a country of optimists. We're the can-do people. And no one understands that more than America's Latinos. No one has a bigger stake in America's future. We just need to believe in ourselves.\nThe poet Langston Hughes told the stories in this way: \"Let America be America again. Let it be the dream it used to be\".– for those \"whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain, whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain must bring back our mighty dream again.\"\nIn 2004, we have to bring back our mighty dream again. We have to make America all that it can become.\nLet America be America again. Que America sea America. Para Todos.\nSi se puede! Si se puede! Si se puede!\nThank you, and God bless you.", "timestamp": "2004-06-29", "title": "Remarks to the National Council of La Raza's 37th Annual Conference in Phoenix, Arizona"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29706", "text": "You know, while running for president, I've had the privilege to travel all over our great country – from big cities to small towns, from coast to coast. And I can't tell you how excited I am to kick off our celebration of America right here in the heartland.\nWe've come to this American birthday party two hundred and twenty-eight times. And it's a party we never get tired of. Each one is better than the last.\nIt's hard to believe that in 1776, when we declared our independence and embarked on this bold experiment, we were only thirteen colonies standing up to a mighty empire. Our greatest weapon was founding promise and driving purpose – that \"all men are created equal ... with certain unalienable rights,\" including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\nAnd because of that promise, we won our independence, secured our freedom, and launched the greatest democracy in the world.\nIt's because of that promise that today we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Civil Rights Act – a bill rooted in our founding ideal, that all people are created equal, no matter what their race, sex, religion, or national origin. We are all deserving of an equal shot at the American dream -- at a good job, a good education, and the right to drink from the same fountain of opportunity.\nToday, we are embarking on a journey to celebrate that promise – the spirit of America. It begins here in Cloquet, where, for a hundred years, you've lived that spirit – in the way you rebuilt the town after it burned ... in the men and women you've sent to war, and honored when they returned ... and in the mill that's helped your economy and fed your families.\nOver the next few days, in that bus right over there, we'll continue our trip across the heart of America, from Independence, Wisconsin to Independence, Iowa. We'll visit towns, farms, march in a parade, eat barbecue, play a little baseball and celebrate who we are.\nAnd we'll honor the values that built our country and strengthened our communities. Family. Responsibility. Service. These are values that are rooted in the heartland, and they are harvested in all you do. One of the best things I've witnessed throughout this campaign is that you can hear the beat of patriotism and see the promise of our country leaping out of you every day in every community in our country.\nYou can hear it on family farms, when the sun first rises, and from the factory floor, where the churning of machines are the sounds of America's strength.\nAnd you can hear it on Main Street, where family businesses open onto friendly sidewalks, and neighbors never lock their doors. You can smell it at barbecues and hear it at baseball games, where the crack of the bat echoes across town.\nAnd you'll see it Sunday, on July 4th, with the ripple of flags and the dazzling display of fireworks.\nIt's the sound and the spirit of America. It's the promise of the American dream. And it's the reason we're gathered here today. Because on November 2nd, that sound and spirit, that promise from the heartland, will renew our country again. Together, we'll build an America stronger at home and once again respected in the world. Together we will bring an end to the Bush Administration.\nBecause I believe we can – and we will – do better than we're doing today.\nThis Administration says this is the best economy of our lifetime. They say this is the best we can do. They've even called us pessimists. Well, I say, the most pessimistic thing you can say is that America can't do better.\nDon't tell us a million and a half lost jobs is the best we can do, when we can create millions of new jobs. We can do better and we will.\nDon't tell us losing 1300 dairy farms in Minnesota is the best we can do. We have the best family farmers in America, but we're denying you the fair chance to compete in the global marketplace. We can do better and we will.\nDon't tell us crumbling schools and underpaid teachers are the best we can do. We have the means to give all our children a first-rate education. We can do better. And we will.\nDon't tell us $2 a gallon at the tank is the best we can do. We have the technology in the fields of Minnesota to make us energy independent of Mideast oil. We can do better. And we will.\nI believe we can fight for good-paying jobs that let American families actually get ahead – and in an America where the middle class is doing better, not being squeezed.\nI believe that, once and for all, we can protect the family farm.\nI believe we can make health care a right for all of our people, especially those in rural America.\nI believe we can make this nation energy independent.\nI believe we can build a strong military, and lead strong alliances, so young Americans are never put in harm's way because we insisted on going it alone.\nMen like the three marines Carlton County lost this year, including Private Langhorst, Private Milczark and Lance Corporal Angell who lived in Cloquet, just around the corner from here.\nAs you know, the war in Iraq and Afghanistan has hit small town America particularly hard; so many sons and daughters have left home and gone half a world away to serve and sacrifice for our country. You've lost friends, family members, firefighters and police, and many others who mean so much -- so many have been lost. On this Independence weekend, we honor their lives, and we pray for their families and for all the men and women still in harms ways.\nI believe they should come home to an America we can all be proud of – with good paying jobs, good education, and good health care.\nIt's time to remember a basic truth: a stronger America begins right here at home.\nMore than a million Americans who were working three years ago have lost their jobs – including those on the iron range in Minnesota. And the new jobs finally being created pay an average of $9,000 less a year. But, as wages are going down, your health care costs are going up; your tuitions are going up; your bills are going up.\nAnd to add insult to injury, your hard-earned tax dollars are actually paying corporations to export your jobs. So, more and more of you are working weekends; some of you are working two jobs, three jobs – and you're still not getting ahead. I have a plan to keep good paying jobs at the heart of our economy.\nDid you know that right now your tax dollars are being used to reward companies that ship Minnesota jobs overseas? That's inexcusable. When I'm president, American taxpayers will never again subsidize the loss of their own jobs.\nLet me tell you: America needs a president who fights for your job as hard as he fights for his own.\nWe're going to close tax loopholes that pay companies to move our jobs overseas – and we're going to reward companies that create good jobs here in America.\nMy plan calls for tough enforcement of our trade agreements. We're gonna stop other countries from violating those agreements and walking away with the store. And we're gonna fight for labor and environment protections in every single trade agreement.\nBecause I'll tell you what I've seen traveling across this country, if you give American workers a level playing field, with free and fair trade, there's no one in the world that the American worker can't compete against.\nAnd we're going to level the playing field by investing in broadband in rural America, so our small business can compete against any other in the world. We can't expect America to grow in the digital age if pockets of our country are still living in the dark.\nAnd nothing threatens our future growth and priorities more than a federal budget that's out of balance because federal priorities are out of whack.\nI believe it's wrong for middle-class Americans to be saddled with endless debt and deficits, while the most fortunate among us walk away with billions in tax cuts. As president, I will fight to put America's tax code in line with our moral code.\nYou know, our tax code has gone from 14 pages to 17,000 pages. Do any of you have your own page? Enron got its own a page. Exxon got its own page. And it looks like Halliburton got a whole chapter. That's wrong.\nWe're going to cut taxes for the middle class. That's why to build a strong economy, I'll cut middle-class taxes, so middle-class incomes go up.\nAnd we're going to cut the deficit in half by closing corporate loopholes, rolling back the Bush tax cuts for those who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in education and health care, and cut the deficit in half.\nYou know, we restored fiscal responsibility in the 1990s. We cut the deficit, we protected Social Security, and we created 23 million new jobs – the longest period of prosperity in our nation's history. And together we can do it again.\nFamilies who work hard and do the right thing deserve a country that does right by them. Being strong at home means health care that is affordable and accessible to all Americans.\nOn the campaign trail, I met John and Mary Ann Knowles. John lost his job a year and a half ago, and Mary Ann has breast cancer. And even while she underwent chemotherapy, she still had to go to work every day – just to hang onto their health insurance.\nThat's the story of millions of Americans. And it's the story of Minnesotans, and nearly 25 percent of rural America. Not only do they lack health insurance, but so many of you have to drive an hour and half just to see a doctor. But you know, it's not the story of senators and congressmen. Because they give themselves great health care coverage and they give you the bill.\nI'm running for President because I believe your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, DC.\nLet me just ask you:\nHave your health insurance premiums gone up in the last few years?\nHave your co-payments gone up?\nHave your deductibles gone up?\nThen you need to tell this Administration we're fed up and their time is up.\nFor almost four years, they've had no plan, while rising health care costs are hurting families and making it harder and harder for businesses to compete. My plan will take on the waste in the health care system. It will reduce the average premium by up to $1,000 a year. It will crack down on skyrocketing drug prices. And it will improve access for rural communities, with funding for more health care clinics and services.\nAnd let me tell you: it's time to give seniors a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare.\nAnd in a Kerry Administration, we will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the elected and the connected or the wealthy – it is a right for every American.\nAnd a stronger America is an America free and independent of Mideast oil.\nWe're going to renew our freedom, and control our own destiny. We're going to invest in new technologies and alternative fuels, like ethanol, create tax incentives for more fuel efficient cars – and we're going to reward the consumers who buy them. And we're going to issue a declaration of energy independence from Mideast oil. My friends, we can invent and grow our way to energy independence – we just need to put our minds to work.\nAbove all, we're going to do this because no young American in uniform should ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Mideast.\nNow there are those who question our patriotism when we offer a better course for our country. So here is our answer when they exploit fear and the flag for their political purposes: That flag doesn't belong to any President or any ideology or any party.\nI fought under that flag. That flag has been draped across the caskets of men I fought with, and friends I grew up with. That flag stands for the best hopes of all Americans and it belongs to all of the American people.\nWhen I was in Vietnam, I served on a small boat on the Mekong Delta with men who came from places as diverse as South Carolina and Iowa ... Arkansas and California. We were literally all in the same boat – and we came together as one. No one asked us our politics. No one cared where we went to school or what our race or backgrounds were.\nWe were just a band of brothers who all fought under the same flag, and all prayed to the same God. Today, we're a little bit older, we're a little bit greyer. But we still know how to fight for our country. And what we're fighting for is an America where all of us are truly in the same boat.\nSo, I ask for your help. Talk to your neighbors; talk to your friends. Enlist in our cause.\nIn great movements for civil rights and equal rights, the environment and economic justice for all, we have come together as one America to give life to our mighty dream.\nSo come together again and stand up for a great purpose – to make America stronger at home and respected in the world. We're a country of the future; we're a country of optimists. We're the can-do people. And we just need to believe in ourselves.\nThe poet Langston Hughes put it this way: \"Let America be America again. Let it be the dream it used to be\" – for those \"whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain, whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain must bring back our mighty dream again.\"\nIn 2004, we have to bring back our mighty dream again. We have to make America all that it can become.\nLet America be America again!

I want to wish everyone a happy Fourth of July weekend.\nForty years ago, on July 2, 1964, Lyndon Johnson signed the most sweeping civil rights legislation since the end of the civil war. With a stroke of the pen, Johnson decreed that America would live up to its founding creed, \"that all men are created equal.\" The bill was signed at the White House, but as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. understood, in truth, it \"was written in the streets\" of America. It was written by the foot soldiers in the sweltering heat of Birmingham and in cities and towns all across the South. It was written by freedom fighters armed only with the truth, who climbed aboard buses and marched into the blast of a fire hose...the bark of a dog, without ever resorting to violence. It was written by men and women like John Lewis, Dr. King, Dorothy Height and Jesse Jackson, who put their minds and their bodies into the crucible of hatred so we would all see a better day.\nOn this 40th anniversary of its passage, it is also important to remember that foot soldiers for freedom come in all colors. We should remember that for every Bull Connor or George Wallace standing in the schoolhouse door, there were scores of people like Viola Liuozzo, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, who along with James Chaney, gave their lives working to clear the path to freedom. We should not forget men of courage like Cesar Chavez who fought for the rights of immigrant workers or Rabbi Abraham Heschel who joined Dr. King and others in putting their lives on the frontlines of the often perilous march to freedom.\nThe truth is, while the civil rights act was primarily passed to ensure equal opportunity for African Americans, it has benefited all of us and made America a more perfect union. It was rooted in the fundamental ideal that every American, regardless of race, sex, religion or national origin, deserves an equal shot at the American Dream – at a good job, a good education, and the right to share in the promise of America.\nAs we celebrate our many freedoms this Fourth of July, we should remember that those freedoms are rooted in the courageous struggle for civil rights that reached a turning point 40 years ago this week. And we must not slumber under the false assumption that our work is done. As Dr. King told us, the Civil Rights Act was \"only the beginning of a new day...not the end of a journey.\"\nWe have removed the barriers of hate that kept us from drinking at the same water fountain or attending the same school. The next step in our journey must be to remove the barriers that keep us from drinking at the same fountain of opportunity. Our work is not yet done when the current Administration refuses to back up its promise of quality education with funding that would truly leave no child behind.\nOur work is not yet done when in the richest nation on earth, 44 million Americans don't have health insurance and people of color are significantly more likely to suffer and die from diseases like cancer and AIDS and diabetes.\nOur work is not yet done when right-wing judges are turning back the clock, eroding many of the civil rights gains of the past 40 years. And when the Administration in Washington is sowing new seeds of division, not unity.\nI believe in an America that fights to right those wrongs. And I have a plan to move us forward. It is a plan that puts and keeps good paying jobs at the heart of our economy. It closes loop holes that pay companies to move our jobs overseas. It is a plan that will make high-quality health care affordable and available to all. It is a plan that invests in the education of our children and workers and gives them the tools to succeed.\nAnd it is a plan that strengthens our civil rights laws, including passage of the Fairness Act, which upholds our highest values of equality and opportunity for every American. Forty years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, I ask you to join me in re-dedicating ourselves to continuing the journey and making real our pledge of \"liberty and justice for all.\"\nThanks for listening.", "timestamp": "2004-07-03", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation"}

I am pleased to announce that the next Vice President of the United States will be John Edwards of North Carolina.\nThis campaign for the presidency really began two years ago. Throughout those two years as well as four years before that, I have worked with John Edwards side by side and sometimes head to head.\nI've seen John Edwards think, argue, advocate, legislate and lead for six years now. I know his skill. I know his passion. I know his strength. I know his conscience. I know his faith. He has honored the lessons of home and family learned in North Carolina, and brings those values to this struggle to shape a better future for America. He is ready for this job.\nThere's something else about John Edwards that is important to this campaign and our country at this critical time: I am determined that we reach out across party lines, that we speak the heart of America – hope and optimism. And John Edwards will join me in doing that.\nAs so many of you know, throughout the campaign, John talked about the great divide in this country – the \"Two Americas\" – that exists between those who are doing well and those who are struggling to make it from day to day. That concern is at the center of this campaign. It is what it is all about. It has been part of my fight for 35 years. And I am so proud that together we're going to build one America.\nAs a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a leader in fighting bioterrorism, he shares my unshakable commitment to maintaining a military second to none, and to restoring old and building new alliances.\nThere's also a great bonus to having John on this ticket – and that's a strong, brave woman, Elizabeth Edwards. Teresa and I and our family will be proud to stand with the Edwards family in this campaign – with their daughter Cate, who just graduated from college, and with their little ones Emma Claire and Jack.\nAnyone who knows them, knows that this is a family that loves one another and loves America.\nIn the next 120 days, John Edwards and I will be fighting for the America we love.\nWe'll be fighting to make America stronger at home and more respected in the world.\nWe'll be fighting for good paying jobs that let American families actually get ahead – an America where the middle class is doing better, not being squeezed.\nWe'll be fighting to make healthcare a right for all our people.\nWe'll be fighting to make this nation energy independent.\nWe'll be fighting to build a strong military and lead strong alliances, so young Americans are never put in harm's way because we insisted on going it alone.\nAnd we're going to win this fight by standing together, not as two Americas, but as one America.\nWhen I was in Vietnam, I served on a small boat on the Mekong Delta with men who came from places as diverse as South Carolina and Iowa... Arkansas and California. No one asked us our politics. No one cared where we went to school or what our race or backgrounds were.

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29709", "text": "Thank you for inviting me to this extraordinary conference. And congratulations to all the newly elected Bishops. [Acknowledgements] I want you to know that I am proud to have a member of the AME Church as my head negotiator for the presidential debates. Vernon Jordan grew up in the St. Paul AME Church in Atlanta. He is currently a member of the Metropolitan AME Church in Washington D.C., and I value his support and counsel in this campaign.\nBefore I begin, I want to make sure you all caught up to an announcement I made this morning in Pittsburgh. As I hope you know by now, I was proud to announce my Vice Presidential running mate. I have chosen a man who understands and defends the values of America, a man who has shown courage and conviction as a champion for middle class Americans and those struggling to reach the middle class – a man who has shown guts, determination and political skill in his own race for the Presidency – a man whose life has prepared him for leadership and whose character brings him to exercise it. And if by some chance you haven't heard it, I am pleased to announce that the next Vice President of the United States will be Senator John Edwards of North Carolina.\nYour lives speak volumes: While America is a land of tolerance for every belief, it can never be a place of indifference to faith. We should never separate our highest beliefs and values from our treatment of one another and our conduct of the people's business.\nThat is what I want to talk with you about today. America needs a new era of responsibility. And those of us in leadership would do well to follow your lead.\nWe can learn much about economic development, self-help and personal responsibility from the good work being done by Rev. Floyd Flake in New York and Rev. Cecil Murray in Los Angeles. We can be inspired by the work to clothe the naked, feed the hungry and house the homeless that is being done by Rev. Walter Walters of St. Paul AME right here in Indianapolis. These are just a few examples of the AME commitment to taking responsibility and expanding the church beyond its walls into the lives of people in need in neighborhoods and communities all over this nation.\nScripture teaches us: \"It is not enough, my brother, to say you have faith, when there are no deeds... Faith without works is dead.\"\nYour faith is alive, but when I look around this city – when I look around neighborhoods and towns and cities all across this country, I see what so many of you see everyday.\nWe see jobs to be created.\nWe see families to house.\nWe see violence to stop.\nWe see children to teach – and children to care for.\nWe see too many people without health care and too many people of color suffering and dying from preventable diseases like cancer and AIDS and diabetes.\nWe look at what is happening in America today and we say: Where are the deeds? For the last four years all we have heard is empty words.\nWell, let me tell you something. I am running for president because it's time to turn the words into deeds, and faith into action. I believe that talk is cheap. It is time to back up our words with action. And, as president, that is just what I am going to do.\nForty years ago, last week, that question was answered when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law. But even though the bill was signed at the White House, Dr. King and others understood that \"it was written in the streets of America\"...by the foot soldiers in the sweltering heat of Birmingham and around this nation who put their bodies into the crucible of hate so we would all see a better day.\nThey didn't wait for anyone to give them permission. They saw a problem. They took responsibility for fixing it. And they changed the inner life of America forever.\nToday, we have an Administration in Washington that looks at the challenges we face here at home and around the world and says this is the best we can do. They say this is the best economy of our lifetimes. They have even called us pessimists for speaking truth to power. Well, I say the most pessimistic thing you can say is that America can't do better.\nDon't tell us disenfranchising a million African Americans and stealing their votes is the best we can do. This time, in 2004, not only will every vote count – we're going to make sure that every vote is counted.\nDon't tell us 1.8 million lost jobs is the best we can do, when we can create millions of new jobs. We can do better...and we will.\nDon't tell us unemployment is not a problem anymore, when we see that African American unemployment is now above 10 percent – double the rate for whites. We can do better...and we will.\nDon't tell us overcrowded schools and underpaid teachers are the best we can do. We have the means to give all our children a first-rate education. We can do better...and we will.\nDon't' tell us $2 a gallon at the pump is the best we can do. We have the technology to make America energy independent of Mideast oil. We can do better...and we will.\nDon't tell us in the richest country in the world, that we can't do better than 44 million people uninsured. We can do better...and we will.\nDon't tell us that it takes four years of rhetoric about AIDS in Africa and African development to get something done. As president, I will fully fund the fight against AIDS in Africa and make sustainable development on the continent a priority.\nThere are so many issues that call us to put our faith into action. And let me tell you there are two priorities that leap out at us if we are going to change the direction of our country. We have to make sure that fathers are there for the children they help bring into this world and we have to close the divisions between the two Americas – the haves and the have nots; the people who can do and the people who they just won't let do.\nAs you all know, over the course of my life, I have been a soldier, a prosecutor and a Senator. And I have always tried to give my best. But there is no job that has taught me more or been tougher, or more rewarding than being a father to my two daughters, Vanessa and Alexandra. Fatherhood is not an exact science and we all make mistakes. But I am convinced that every father can be a good father, if he loves his children, respects their mother and does all he can to support them.\nHere is what fatherhood has taught me.\nChildren need the love and discipline of fathers as much as they need it from mothers.\nChildren need to get their role models at home – not from the media.\nFathers need to show their children, particularly their sons, that raising a baby, not making a baby is what makes you a man.\nWe can help more fathers make the right decision by finishing the job of welfare reform. It's brought millions of mothers into the workplace already, and that's a good thing. But mothers shouldn't bear the whole burden alone.\nWe need to offer the same approach to dads – offering opportunities for training and jobs, but also demanding the responsibilities we ask of every parent, including work and child support.\nAnd I invite churches and faith-based institutions to continue to play the role they have always played – as leaders, teachers, and guides in our communities. I know there are some who say that the First Amendment means faith-based organizations can't help government. I think they are wrong. I want to offer support for your efforts, including financial support, in a way that supports our Constitution and civil rights laws and values the role of faith in inspiring countless acts of justice and mercy across our land.\nI see what you see everyday. When I was a prosecutor, I used to talk to the kids in trouble who came before me. I wanted to learn about their lives. There wasn't one of those kids I met who didn't come from a neglected home, a background of abuse, poverty or awful violence. And too many of them had no one to call father. I believe we have to stop being a country content with spending $50-$70 thousand dollars a year to send a kid to prison for life, when we could spend $10-$11 thousand to give a child a Head Start, a Healthy Start, an Early Start. We need to increase our support for programs like Youth Build which offers training, education and the opportunity for service to thousands of young people so they can get good jobs and become responsible parents and citizens.\nIn short, we need to help our children at the front end of their lives so we won't have to pick up the pieces on the downside.\nBut we also need to teach the lesson of responsibility, which is what you do everyday. All of us have to be responsible for our actions, from the President in the White House to people in their homes and schools and workplaces across this country. And we owe it to all the people who follow the law to hold accountable those who don't.\nLet's not kid ourselves. In the end, government can't raise our children. It's up to each of us to teach our children good values, to always be there for them, and to make sure they learn right from wrong.\nThat is part of my vision for a stronger America here at home.\nDr. King reminded us that \"Human progress never rolls on the wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men [and women] willing to be co-workers with God...\" Dr. King was calling us to take responsibility.\nSeveral months ago, President Clinton quoted the prophet Isaiah in support of my candidacy. \"Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying...Whom shall I send. And who will go for us. And I said, ‘Here I am. Send me.'\"\nPresident Clinton paid me the compliment of telling that audience whenever there was a call to service in war or in peace, I have always answered that call.\nToday I say, when we look at the problems of this present age, we must all answer, \"Send me.\"\nWith one clear voice, we must all say: Send me to fight for good-paying jobs that let American families actually get ahead – an America where the middle class is doing better, not being squeezed.\nSend me to make it clear that health care is a right, not a privilege in America, reserved only for the wealthy or the elected or the connected.\nSend me to fight for a good education for all our children with funding that truly leaves no child behind.\nSend me to alleviate poverty and hopelessness wherever they exist in America.\nSend me to make this nation energy independent so that no young American in uniform is ever held hostage to our dependence on Mideast oil.\nSend me to build a strong military, and lead strong alliances, so young Americans are never put in harm's way because we needlessly insisted on going it alone.\nMy friends, we can create an America stronger at home and respected in the world if we put aside our divisions and come together in common purpose. If we all answer the call by saying, \"Send me.\" If we remember the words of your founder, Richard Allen, who said, \"Skin may differ but ability dwells in black and white the same.\"\nThe only way to move this country forward is together. We must remember that the presidency is more than one person or even one party. The presidency embodies the hopes and dreams of every American. The presidency is the people.\nWhen I was in Vietnam, I served on a small boat in the Mekong Delta with men who came from places as diverse as South Carolina and Iowa...Arkansas and California. We were literally all in the same boat – and we came together as one. No one asked us our politics. No one cared where we went to school or what our race or backgrounds were.\nWe were just a band of brothers who all fought under the same flag and all prayed to the same God. Today, we're a little bit older, we're a little bit greyer. But we still know how to fight for our country. And what we're fighting for is an America where all of us are truly in the same boat.\nIn great movements for civil rights and equal rights, the environment and economic justice for all, we have come together as one America to give life our highest ideals. Scripture tells us there is \"a time to break down and a time to build up.\" This is our time to break down division and build up unity. This is our time to reject the politics of fear. This is our time, as Langston Hughes so eloquently put it, to:\n\"Let America be America again...Let it be the dream it used to be...for those whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain, whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain must bring back our mighty dream again.\"\nSo, let us pray. Let us move our feet. Let us march together and let us lead America in a new direction – toward that mountaintop which has always been our destination. We won't get there in one year or one election. But this year is our time to let America be America again...to bring back our mighty dream.\nSend me.\nThank you and God bless you all.", "timestamp": "2004-07-06", "title": "Remarks to the AME Convention in Indianapolis"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29700", "text": "Good morning, this is John Kerry.\nYesterday, we said goodbye to President Ronald Reagan.\nFor his children and his friends, and most of all, for his courageous wife Nancy, this painful goodbye began almost ten years ago, with the diagnosis of a disease that took Ronald Reagan away before it took his life.\nThere is a moment after you get the call from a doctor that you or a loved one must face a disease like Alzheimer's where you decide that it can't mean the end – that you won't let it. So in our own way, we become researchers and scientists. We become advocates and friends, and we reach for a cure that cannot – that must not – be too far away.\nSome call this denial. But I'm sure that Nancy Reagan – the wife of an eternal optimist – calls it hope.\nShe told the world that Alzheimer's had taken her own husband to a distant place, and then she stood up to help find a breakthrough that someday will spare other husbands, wives, children and parents from the same kind of heartache.\nMillions share this hope, and it is because of their commitment that stem cell research has brought us closer to finding ways to treat Alzheimer's and many other diseases.\nToday, more than 100 million Americans have illnesses that one day could be cured or treated with stem-cell therapy. Stem cells could replace damaged heart cells or cells destroyed by cancer, offering a new lease on life to those suffering from diseases that once came with a certain death sentence. Stem cells have the power to slow the loss of a grandmother's memory, calm the hand of an uncle with Parkinson's, save a child from a lifetime of daily insulin shots, or permanently lift a best friend from his wheelchair.\nChances are that you love someone with such a disease. You may be that someone. So what can we do to make sure that doctors and scientists keep learning, keep discovering, and keep researching stem cells so that the incredible potential for discovery becomes a reality in people's lives?\nWe must lift the barriers that stand in the way of science and push the boundaries of medical exploration so that researchers can find the cures that are there, if only they are allowed to look. We can do this while providing strict ethical oversight.\nWe must make the funding of stem cell research a priority in our universities and our medical community. And we must secure more funding for it at agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.\nAbove all, we must look to the future not with fear, but with the hope and the faith that advances in medicine will advance our best values. America has always been a land of discovery – of distant horizons and unconquered frontiers. But progress has always brought with it ethical concerns that this time we have gone too far. Believe it or not, there was a time when some questioned the morality of heart transplants. Not too long ago, we heard the same kind of arguments against the biotechnology research that now saves stroke victims and those with leukemia.\nI know there are ethical issues, but people of goodwill and good sense can resolve them. For I also know the fear that most Americans feel at some point – the fear of a diagnosis that may take our life or sentence us to a diminished life.\nIn the past few years, I have seen cancer and stroke take my own parents. Last year, because of the remarkable medical advances we have made, I was cured of prostate cancer. Now everywhere I go in America, people come up to me and tell me about their struggle with illness or the bravery of family members who faces it. They share their worries, but they also believe that this is a country of the future, a can-do country.\nThe medical discoveries that come from stem cell are crucial next steps in humanity's uphill climb. And part of this nation's greatness lies in the fact that we have led the world in great medical discoveries, with our breakthroughs and our beliefs going hand-in-hand.\nIf we pursue the limitless potential of our science – and trust that we can use it wisely – we will save millions of lives and earn the gratitude of future generations.\nThanks for listening.", "timestamp": "2004-07-12", "title": "Democratic Radio Address"}

I understand that you've been having trouble getting some speakers.\nSeriously, thank you for the invitation. Some people may have better things to do, but there's no place I'd rather be right now than right here in Philadelphia with the NAACP.\nAs a campaigner, I know a little something about scheduling conflicts and hostile environments. But when you're president of the United States, you can pretty much say where you want to be. And when you're president, you need to talk to all the people – and that's exactly what I intend to do. I will be a president who truly is a uniter, not one who seeks to divide our nation by race, riches or any other label. You know, the president may be too busy to speak to you now, but I assure you, he'll have plenty of free time after November 2nd.\nLater today, John Edwards and I will embark on a series of front-porch tours – going to the homes of ordinary citizens across this nation and talking with them about the values that matter most to them -- values you live by everyday: Family. Responsibility. Service. Opportunity. Inclusion. Fairness. Faith. And the most revolutionary value of all – that we are all created equal.\nWhat better place to kick off our front porch tour than here in Philadelphia, on the front porch of American democracy. What better neighbors to visit with first than the NAACP. For 95 years you have met, marched, litigated, legislated, registered, prayed, sang, gone to jail and challenged this nation to live out the values that unite us -- the ideals of equal opportunity, fairness and justice that are enshrined in the Constitution. You have not always been greeted with open arms. But you have never flinched from speaking truth to power and you have never lost faith in the American Dream. Who wouldn't want to sit on the front porch of neighbors like that? And, you know what, we have a lot to talk about.\nWhen I look around this city – when I look around neighborhoods and towns and cities across this nation, I see what so many of you see everyday.\nWe see jobs to be created.\nWe see families to house.\nWe see violence to stop.\nWe see children to teach – and children to care for.\nWe see too many people without health care and too many people of color suffering and dying from chronic diseases like asthma, cancer, AIDS and diabetes.\nWhen we look at what is happening in America today, we ask ourselves where are the deeds. Scripture teaches us: \"It is not enough, my brother, to say you have faith, when there are no deeds ... Faith without works is dead.\"\nFifty years ago, Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP turned their faith into deeds when you fought and won Brown v Board of Education. Forty years ago, Lyndon Johnson, Dr. King and the NAACP turned their faith into deeds when the nation passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And next year the nation will again be reminded that you turned faith into deeds 40 years ago to push for the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nToday, we have an administration in Washington that looks at the challenges we face here and around the world and says this is the best we can do. They say what we have now is the best economy of our lifetimes. They have even called us pessimists for speaking truth to power. Well, I say the most pessimistic thing you can say is that America can't do better.\nDon't tell us 1.8 million lost jobs is the best we can do, when we can create millions of new jobs. We can do better...and we will.\nDon't tell us unemployment is not a problem, when we see that African American unemployment is now above 10 percent – double the rate for whites. It is unacceptable in the wealthiest nation on earth that we tolerate vast and growing pockets of poverty -- from the hills of Appalachia to the streets of Philadelphia. Making life better for the working poor is part of my vision for a stronger America. We can do better...and we will.\nDon't tell us crumbling and overcrowded schools and underpaid teachers are the best we can do. We have the means to give all our children a first-rate education. We can do better...and we will.\nDon't tell us we have to accept racial profiling, hate crimes, or the assault by right wing judges on our precious civil rights progress. We can do better and we will.\nDon't tell us that in the strongest democracy on earth, a million disenfranchised African Americans and the most tainted election in history is the best we can do. We can do better...and we will.\nDon't tell us in the richest country in the world, that we can't do better than 44 million people uninsured. Nearly 60 percent of Hispanics and 43 percent of African Americans lacked health insurance for all or part of the last two years. We can do better...and we will.\nW.E.B. Du Bois talked about the two Americas years ago. He called it \"a nation within a nation.\" John Edwards and I have talked about that divide for many years now.\nOur job, between now and November is to end the division between the fortunate America and the forgotten America. We must come together to build one America.\nDuring the course of this campaign I've met young people who want nothing more than to be able to find a job in the place they were raised. I've met steelworkers and mineworkers and autoworkers who have seen their jobs and equipment unbolted before their eyes and shipped overseas. Some have even had to train their foreign replacements. I've spent time with seniors who have worked for a lifetime but can't pay for their medicines or hardly make ends meet. And I have talked with parents full of hope and ambition for their children but they don't know what to do about classrooms that are overcrowded and teachers who are underpaid. And they are worried that they won't be able to afford to send their kids to college.\nMy faith teaches me, \"Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\" Let me tell you where my heart is: it's with the middle class who are the heart of this country; it's with the working families who built this country; it's with the veterans who saved this country; with the cops and firefighters and soldiers who protect this country; and it is with the children who are the future of this country. They deserve a president who believes in them, who shares their values, and who will fight with every fiber of my being to uphold them.\nJohn Edwards and I have the vision and values to bring our country together again and build stronger communities. For us and for you values are not just talk. They're not just words. Values are the way we make the lives of all Americans better.\nAnd I am running for president because I believe that what matters most is not the narrow values that divide, but the shared values that unite all of us in this country.\nLet me tell you what values mean to me and John Edwards.\nValues mean creating opportunity and fighting for good paying jobs that let American families actually get ahead. It means fighting for tax cuts for middle class families – to help provide relief for Americans who are getting squeezed. The wealthiest Americans don't need more tax cuts, but middle class families do. We will cut taxes for 98 percent of Americans. And we will add new middle class tax cuts to help families pay for health care, college tuition and child care – they'll help hard working Americans get ahead.\nCreating opportunity also means creating good-paying jobs. More than a million Americans who were working three years ago have lost their jobs. African-American unemployment is now at 10 percent – double the rate for whites. And the new jobs finally being created pay an average of $9,000 less a year.\nWe have a plan to keep and create good paying jobs here at home. Did you know that right now your tax dollars are being used to ship jobs from Philadelphia and Baltimore, Detroit and Boston overseas? That's inexcusable. When I am president, no longer will American workers have to subsidize the loss of their own jobs.\nValues also mean giving all our children a first-rate education, with smaller classrooms and better paid teachers. Today, we see two school systems in America: one for the well off and one for the left out. For us and for you values mean opening the doors of opportunity to all our children. John Edwards and I have a plan to invest in our future, provide the needed funding and put a good teacher in every classroom – so that finally and truly no child is left behind.\nValues mean making health care affordable and accessible for all Americans. In the last four years, four million people have lost their health insurance. Millions more are struggling to afford it. When I am in the White House we are going to change that. We are going to stop being the only industrial nation on the face of the earth that doesn't understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected or the elected. Health care is a right for all Americans.\nWe've got a plan to get the waste and greed out of our health care system and help families save up to $1,000 on their premiums.\nValues mean making our country independent of Mideast oil. We've got a plan to invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and protect our environment, so that no young American in uniform is ever held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East.\nValues mean building a strong military and leading strong alliances, so no young American is ever put in harm's way because we needlessly insisted on going it alone. In our Administration, we'll never go to war because we want to; we'll only go to war because we have to.\nFinally, I believe in the value of American leadership in the world. Today, a massive humanitarian crisis is unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, where 300,000 people or more may die in the coming months. This administration must stop equivocating. These government sponsored atrocities should be called by their rightful name – genocide. The government of Sudan and the people of Darfur must understand that America stands prepared to act, in concert with our allies and the UN, to prevent the further loss of innocent lives. The United States must lead the UN Security Council in sanctioning the planners and perpetrators of genocide and authorizing an international humanitarian intervention. As president, I will bring the full weight of American leadership to address this crisis and to promote the democratic hopes of people throughout Africa, Haiti and the Caribbean.\nAnd no crisis challenges the American conscience more than the growing global AIDS pandemic. This audience needs no reminder of the bitter toll that AIDS has exacted here at home. As president, I will make a commitment that by 2008, we will double the amount that America spends fighting global epidemics like AIDS to $30 billion. Fighting AIDS will make us safer, because societies ravaged by AIDS are more likely to become failed states and havens for terrorists. But more than that, fighting AIDS is a moral obligation. How can we see the suffering of so many and turn aside or do too little? If we do not help, who will?\nThis is the most important election of our lifetime. Our health care is on the line. Our jobs are on the line. Our children's future is on the line. America's role in the world is on the line.\nThat is why we cannot accept a repeat of 2000. This November, thanks to the efforts of the NAACP and heightened vigilance across the nation, we are not only going to make sure that every vote counts; we're going to make sure that every single vote is counted.\nOne way to do that is to fulfill the promise of election reform by reauthorizing the expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act, and vigorously enforcing all our voting rights laws. It is a great injustice to us all when African-Americans are denied their fundamental right to vote. On Election Day in your cities, my campaign will provide teams of election observers and lawyers to monitor elections and enforce the law.\nI am also happy to report that we have included language in our convention platform calling for legislative action that will ensure that voting systems are accessible, independently auditable, accurate and secure. We intend to enforce the fundamental constitutional right of every American to vote – to ensure that the Constitution's promise is fully realized and that, in disputed elections, every vote is counted fully and fairly. We learned our lesson in 2000, and I add my voice to those who have vowed: never again.\nBut this election is more in your hands more than in mine. Over the next four months, we need you to do what nobody in America does better -- register voters and get them to the polls.\nWe can provide a new direction for America if we remember that in all the great movements for civil rights and equal rights, the environment and economic justice for all, we have come together as one America to give life to our highest ideals.\nWhen I was in Vietnam, I served on a small boat in the Mekong Delta with men who came from places as diverse as South Carolina and Iowa...Arkansas and California. We were literally all in the same boat – and we came together as one. No one asked us our politics. No one cared where we went to school or what our race or backgrounds were.\nWe were just a band of brothers who all fought under the same flag and all prayed to the same God. Today, we're a little older, we're a little greyer. But we still know how to fight for our country. And what we are fighting for is an America where all of us truly are in the same boat.\nMy friends, the America we believe in is calling us to service once again, and we must answer.\nThe great poet Langston Hughes put it this way:\nLet America be America again...Let it be the dream it used to be...for those whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain, whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain must bring back our mighty dream again.\nWith your help, in 2004, we can...we must...we will...bring back our mighty dream again.\nThank you and God bless you all.", "timestamp": "2004-07-15", "title": "Remarks to the 95th Annual NAACP Convention in Philadelphia"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29711", "text": "It is an honor to be here with all of you today.\nEvery day, so many of you prove that the difference between a life of sorrow and a life filled with success can be the guidance of a good teacher. Your commitment and your passion encourage us to hope for the very best in our schools. And your willingness to become involved in public service is a reminder that in America, optimists are found on every corner.\nYears ago, one of our most courageous optimists grew up on a most forgotten American corner. As a little girl living in a Coney Island tenement, she attended New York Public School 188. And from the day her second-grade teacher gave her her very first book, she began a lifetime giving back to our teachers, our schools, and our children.\nAs Sandy Feldman has often said, if that school was not there, she would not be here.\nFortunately for teachers everywhere and the children who count on them, it was there, she is here, and her seven years of leadership has brought us closer to an America where quality education is there for every child. Sandy Feldman, we are moved by your public dedication and inspired by your personal courage. Thank you.\nYour example and the example of every member of the AFT – from our nurses and health care workers to our public employees and paraprofessionals – show us what it means to live by real American values: serving your communities, caring for our families, providing opportunity for our young people, and taking responsibility for giving them the best you have to offer.\nThese are values that built America, and I am running for President because I believe it's time our government stood for the same values you do.\nValues are not just talk. They're what we live. They're about the choices we make, the causes we champion, and the people we fight for.\nAnd we believe that what matters is not the narrow values that divide -- it's the shared values that unite all of us in this country\nWe value education as the path to opportunity in America. And we value the teachers who dedicate their lives to giving our young people the best possible start in life.\nThat means understanding that we can't create good schools on the cheap. And it means ensuring that there's a good teacher at the front of every classroom in America.\nOne of my favorite high school teachers was named John Walker. He was the kind of teacher who always encouraged you to do your very best. He pushed you. He believed in you. He inspired you. And if you ever stopped trying, he'd remind you that effort is everything.\nTeachers like John Walker are demanding. But they're the ones who make a difference. You never forget your great teachers. They stay with you, throughout your life, looking over your shoulder and pushing you forward.\nThis is personal for me. You see my other favorite teacher just happens to be my sister, Diana. Diana and the other teachers and educational support professionals that I've met go far and above the call of duty for their students – sometimes spending a thousand dollars of their own money to give their classes better text books and supplies.\nDiana loves being a teacher. But her school in Boston had to cut back. That meant larger class sizes, less opportunity and less hope. And it meant that my sister was laid off because of budget cuts – instead of being rewarded for making a difference.\nLet me tell you, we value our children's future by hiring new teachers and paying them more – not by sacrificing the great teachers we already have.\nWe can make America stronger by making a new commitment to our schools and our children. They don't need a politician's praise. They need a president who values a good education as the gateway to a good job, a better life, and the best America. And if you send me to the White House, that's exactly the kind of President we'll have. My first priority will be to meet our financial responsibilities to our schools.\nWhen the No Child Left Behind Act became law, Congress and this administration made a commitment to our nation's children. We said we're going to raise standards, and we're going to make sure you have the resources to get the job done. Well, two months after the law was signed, this Administration tried to break their promise by shortchanging the law by $27 billion. Millions of children have been left behind – left with overcrowded classrooms, left without textbooks, and left without the high-quality tests that measure what they are learning.\nI'll tell you what: politicians who talk about valuing morality and personal responsibility ought to start by keeping their own promises.\nIt's time to make these reforms work. And it's time to fully fund No Child Left Behind.\nWe also need to do something about the infrastructure of our schools. Thousands of schools across America are crumbling today. What does that say about valuing our kids' future? When I am President, we will build and rebuild, modernize and repair, our school buildings with new school modernization bonds.\nBut I have to tell you, even after we put in these resources, we will still have a lot left to do. As I've often said, reform without resources is a waste of time and resources without reform is a waste of money. We need to continue the work of reform, and improve education in America. The AFT has been a leader in promoting education reform, because you know that we owe our children the best we have to offer.\nSo I want to talk about three great challenges facing our educational system today, and how I plan to meet them.\nFirst, we need a national effort to put a good teacher in every classroom. That means we need to offer teachers more and ask more of them at the same time.\nPay for teachers in America today is a national disgrace. We need to raise it – starting in the poorest schools and in the subjects where we face the most serious teacher shortages. Teachers deserve more support, mentoring, and continuing education so they don't feel like they're left to sink or swim. And we need career developments so successful teachers get the added responsibilities and respect they deserve.\nWe need to treat teachers more like the professionals that they are and pay them more like professionals. Not only does that mean higher pay; it means new rewards for teachers who gain advanced training and excel in raising student achievement. And teachers deserve due process protection from arbitrary dismissal, but we must have fast, fair procedures for improving or removing teachers who aren't performing. We should hold all teachers to the same high standards you apply to yourselves.\nAnd today, one of the biggest obstacles to higher pay for teachers is the rising cost of health care. You've all seen it during negotiations. The money that should be going into your pockets is going to pay for the rising cost of health care. That's why I've got a plan to get the waste and greed of our health care system and help families save up to $1,000 on their premiums. This will help all working Americans earn the pay they deserve.\nSecond, we need a national movement to raise graduation rates. It's time to make and keep a commitment to leave no high school student behind by tracking graduation rates just like we track test scores.\nAnd then we need to invest more in the children who are falling behind – with tutoring and mentoring. This will send those kids a signal: not only do we want you to finish high school, but we want you to have the tools and the skills and the knowledge to go to college. And we need more after-school programs for kids – so that they can get extra help in school instead of getting into trouble. That's why my plan will extend after-school to more than 3.5 million kids across America.\nAnd finally, we need to send more young people to college and help them graduate. My plan will provide new incentives to hold tuitions down and a new refundable tax credit on up to $4000 of tuition. We can never stand back and shrug pessimistically at the fact that 220,000 young people have to walk away from their dream of going to college simply because they can't afford it. We can't afford to lose those bright minds. We value our children too much.\nWe can't provide a 21st century education in 19th century schools. No broken promises on funding. No more empty rhetoric on reform. No privatizing the public jobs that strengthen our communities. And no vouchers. For too long politicians have used private school vouchers to avoid responsibility. As president I will meet our responsibilities. We're going to get this done right because we know that empty rhetoric and empty promises lead to empty dreams – and we won't let that happen in our America.\nWe can do this, because we know that America's best days lie ahead. And because Americans have always reached for the impossible, looked toward the next horizon, and asked \"what if?\"\nWhat if this airplane could take off at Kitty Hawk and change the world forever? What if we could go to the moon in ten years? What if we could take all the information in the world and put it in a little chip, the size of a fingernail. If you'd told anyone that 50 years ago, they wouldn't have believed you. But you know what? We did them. And we're going to keep pushing those boundaries in the future.\nWhat if we cured Parkinson's, diabetes, and Alzheimer's? What if all Americans could have health care? What if our schools could lift all our children up?\nThis is the most important election of our lifetime. Our health care is on the line. Our jobs are on the line. America's role in the world is on the line. Our children's future is on the line.\nBut this election is in your hands more than mine. Over the next four months, will you knock on doors? Will you be part of this effort? Will you talk to your neighbors? Will you bring America back?\nWe need a new conversation. We need to lift ourselves up, reach for the possible, and look to the horizon. We're the can-do people.\nI know that the teachers of America will not rest until we build the future of our children's dreams, for all Americans. And as your President, neither will I. Because you and I believe America can do better. We believe in the possibility of tomorrow. And we believe, as the poet Langston Hughes once wrote, that we must \"Let American be America again.\"", "timestamp": "2004-07-16", "title": "Remarks to the American Federation of Teachers in Washington, DC"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29712", "text": "Thank you, Vernon, for that wonderful introduction. He has been enormously helpful in my campaign. I am grateful for Vernon's common sense and experience – and for his leadership as head of my presidential debate team. The issues we're grappling with today are especially important, and I'm happy to discuss them anywhere, any time, with any American.\nAs all of you know so well-- Vernon is one of America's most effective movers and shakers. I don't have to tell you how he moved and shook up the conscience of America during his tenure as head of this organization during the 1970s. But, then anyone who knows Vernon knows he is not the retiring type! During my twenty years in the Senate, he has constantly reached out to offer quiet counsel, gentle persuasion and sometimes tough criticism. I think he is an American treasure. And I am proud and happy to call him my friend.\nFollowing in the footsteps of the great leaders from George Edmund Haynes, Eugene Kinckle Jones, Lester Blackwell Granger, and Whitney Young, Vernon set a unique standard as head of the Urban League, those who have succeeded him have continued to raise the bar. John Jacobs, Hugh Price and now Marc Morial have continued to challenge this organization and this nation to reach higher, dream bigger and fight harder for the things we all believe in – empowerment, opportunity, responsibility, economic justice, and helping more people move into the mainstream of the American Dream.\nNow, more than ever, when it comes to civil rights, social justice, and empowerment, we need to listen to every voice that stands up and speaks truth to power.\nI also want to say that for me, this is not just a check-the-box campaign stop. Teresa and I are no strangers to the Urban League or the causes you champion. I am proud of the relationships we have established and the partnerships we have formed, particularly with Esther Bush in Pittsburgh, Henry Thomas in Springfield and Darnell Williams in Boston. As president, I will show up, not just at national meetings during election season. I want you at the table with me in a full partnership to build a stronger America at home and a more respected America in the world. There is no other way to really advance our cause -- that is what my campaign is all about.\nIn an address at Cadillac Square here in Detroit in 1960, John Kennedy said, I am confident that in November you will make a choice for progress, not for standing still. We want America to move again...If we stand still, freedom stands still.\"\nThose words ring even more true today.\nWhen I look around this city – when I look around neighborhoods and towns and cities across this nation, I see what so many of you see everyday.\nWe see jobs to be created.\nWe see families to house.\nWe see violence to stop.\nWe see children to teach – and children to care for.\nWe see too many people without health care and too many people of color suffering and dying from preventable diseases like cancer and AIDS and diabetes.\nIn too many places, we see freedom standing still.\nWhen we look at what is happening in America today we must ask ourselves, where are the deeds? The Bible teaches us: \"It is not enough, my brother, to say you have faith, when there are no deeds...Faith without deeds is dead.\"\nFifty years ago, Thurgood Marshall, Whitney Young, the National Urban League and America turned faith into deeds when you fought and won Brown v Board of Education. Forty years ago, Lyndon Johnson, Dr. King, the National Urban League and America turned faith into deeds when the nation passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And next year the nation will again be reminded that you helped turned faith into deeds 40 years ago to push for the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nToday we have an administration in Washington that looks at the challenges we face here and around the world and says this is the best we can do. They say what we have now is the best economy of our lifetimes. They have even called us pessimists for speaking truth to power. Well, I say the most pessimistic thing you can say is that America can't do better.\nDon't tell us 1.8 million lost jobs is the best we can do, when we can create millions of new jobs. We can change that...and we will.\nDon't tell us unemployment is not a problem, when we see that African American unemployment is now above 10 percent – double the rate for whites. It is unacceptable in the wealthiest nation on earth that we tolerate vast and growing pockets of poverty – from the hills of Appalachia to the streets of Detroit. Raising the minimum wage and making life better for the working poor is part of my vision for a stronger America. We can change that...and we will.\nDon't tell us crumbling and overcrowded schools and underpaid teachers are the best we can do. We have the means to give all our children a first-rate education. We can change that...and we will.\nDon't tell us we have to accept racial profiling, hate crimes or the assault by right-wing judges on our precious civil rights progress. We can change that...and we will.\nDon't tell us that in the strongest democracy on earth, a million disenfranchised African Americans and the most tainted election in history is the best we can do. We can change that...and we will.\nDon't tell us in the richest country in the world, that we can't do better than 44 million people uninsured. Nearly 60 percent of Hispanics and 43 percent of African Americans lacked health insurance for all or part of the last two years. We can change that...and we will.\nW.E.B. Dubois talked about the two Americas years ago. He called it \"a nation within a nation.\"\nOur job, between now and November is to end the division between the fortunate America and the forgotten America.\nJohn Edwards and I have talked about closing that gap for many years now. We must come to together to build one America.\nDuring the course of this campaign I've met young people who want nothing more than to be able to find a job in the place they were raised. I've met steelworkers and mineworkers and autoworkers who have seen their jobs and equipment unbolted before their eyes and shipped overseas. Some have even had to train their foreign replacements. I've spent time with seniors who have worked for a lifetime but can't pay for their medicines or hardly make ends meet. And I have talked with parents full of hope and ambition for their children but they don't know what to do about classrooms that are overcrowded and teachers who are underpaid. And they are worried that they won't be able to afford to send their kids to college.\nMy faith teaches me, \"Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\" Let me tell you where my heart is: it's with the middle class who are the heart of this country; it's with the working families who built this country; it's with the veterans who saved this country; with the cops and firefighters and soldiers who protect this country; and it is with the children who are the future of this country. They deserve a president who believes in them, who shares their values, and who with every fiber of his being to uphold them.\nFor four years, we have heard a lot of talk about values. John Edwards and I have the vision and values to bring out country together again and build stronger communities. For us and for you, values are more than just words on a page. They are about the causes we champion and the choices we make.\nAnd I am running for president because I believe that what matters most is not the narrow values that divide, but the shared values that unite all of us in this country.\nLet me tell you what values mean to me and John Edwards.\nValues mean having an opportunity agenda for metropolitan America. That means bringing capital, small business opportunities and job creation to all of our communities – especially our central cities and the surrounding metropolitan areas.\nAs president, I will create a small business opportunity fund to ensure that small businesses have all the support they need to grow and thrive – expanding loans to micro-enterprises, increasing the federal government's venture capital investments and expanding loan programs for small businesses. I will also increase federal contracting opportunities for minority-owned small business growth in urban areas. I will maintain support for empowerment zones, New Markets Tax Incentives and the Community Re-investment Act. And I will make sure the New Market Venture Capital Program has the funding it needs to fulfill its promise of meeting the unmet equity needs of low income communities.\nI will also give states and metropolitan areas the flexibility to use transportation dollars the way you see fit. And I will provide providing adequate funding for homeland security and port security so that the people in our metropolitan areas are able move about freely, get to good jobs and live without fear.\nValues mean helping all Americans lay the cornerstone of the American Dream with the purchase of their own home. The Urban League has a long track record in counseling consumers and fighting to make the dream of homeownership real for millions of people. Yes, it's true, since the 1990s, homeownership has gone up in America. And that's a good thing. But it's not that simple. While homeownership has risen, programs that help hard-pressed families put a roof over their head have been cut. Those are the people we need to help the most. The Administration's budget would cut Section 8 vouchers by more than $1 billion, denying 250,000 families housing assistance. At the same time, he has proposed to entirely eliminate the HOPE VI program, that's been critical to revitalizing distressed public housing.\nJohn Edwards and I understand what you understand: programs like Section 8 and HOPE VI are just the right kind of community-based solutions some people need to get on the road to homeownership. And, when I am president, we will strengthen, not weaken these bridges of opportunity.\nValues also means building an America where the middle class is doing better, not being squeezed. That means cutting middle-class taxes so middle-class incomes go up. The wealthiest among us don't need another tax cut, but middle-class families do. Our middle class tax cuts will help families pay for health care and college tuition; they'll help hard-working Americans get ahead.\nCreating opportunity also means creating good-paying jobs. More than a million Americans who were working three years ago have lost their jobs. African-American unemployment is now at 10 percent – double the rate for whites. And the new jobs finally being created pay an average of $9,000 less a year.\nWe value an America that exports products, not jobs. And we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own jobs.\nWe'll close tax loopholes that pay companies to move our jobs overseas – and we'll reward companies that create jobs right here in the good old USA.\nValues also mean giving all our children a first-rate education, with smaller classrooms and better paid teachers. Today, we see two school systems in America: one for the well off and one for the left out. For us and for you, values mean opening the doors of opportunity to all our children.\nWe believe that educating our children is more important than giving another tax break to the wealthiest Americans. This Administration's budget falls $27 billion short of its promise to fully fund No Child Left Behind. John Edwards and I have a plan to invest in our future, provide the needed funding and put a good teacher in every classroom – so that finally and truly, no child will be left behind.\nValues mean making health care affordable and accessible for all Americans. In the last four years, four million people have lost their health insurance. Millions more are struggling to afford it. When I am in the White House, we are going to change that. We are going to stop being the only industrial nation on the face of the earth that doesn't understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected or the elected. Health care is a right for all Americans.\nWe've got a plan to get the waste and greed out of our health care system and help families save up to $1,000 on their premiums.\nI know that great things are happening across America to strengthen families, lift up communities and bring opportunity and hope to our young people. Some of these efforts are faith-based, some are community based. They are all making a difference. But for every good thing we're doing there are millions more in need who are not being reached. We need to do more to help our faith-based institutions that are on the front lines helping our families, and working with community-based organizations to meet this challenge. And we need to do it in a way that values our Constitution and also values the role that churches play in our communities across America.\nI believe we must do more to give the young people in our cities and metropolitan areas alternatives to lives of hopelessness and alienation. I am glad that the Urban League and this conference have also put that at the top of your agenda. In New York City, 50 percent of black men are unemployed. And New York Times columnist Bob Herbert cited a new study this week showing that \"By 2002, one of every four black men in the United States was idle all year long. This idleness rate was twice as high as that of white and Hispanic males.\" As Herbert put it, \"Things fall apart when 25 percent of the male population is jobless.\"\nOr as my mother used to say, \"An idle mind is the devil's workshop.\"\nOne of the things brewing in that workshop is gangs and gang violence.\nDuring the 1990s, we saw historic drops in crime, including gang violence. But in the last few years, that has turned around. Just between 2000 and 2002, the number of gang-related murders rose by 40 percent. That means that literally hundreds of lives once full of hope and promise have been lost. The response of this administration has been to cut support for cops on the beat and cut support for efforts to prevent gang violence.\nWe can do so much better – better for the communities that are living in fear because of gang violence, and better also for these young people who have a real future if we just reach out to them.\nWhen I am President, we are going to make it a priority to restore safety to communities wracked by violence. Communities and community-based organizations across America have shown us how. First, we're going to send a strong message to young people: the violence must stop, and if it doesn't, police and prosecutors will hold you accountable, period. We're not doing anybody any favors if we let the current rise in gang violence continue. But second, we also need to send young people a strong, clear message that there is another path, and if they are willing to take that path, we will be there with them – with job training, job opportunities, and drug treatment.\nAs a former prosecutor, I talked with dozens of young men and women who had taken wrong turns and wound up in real trouble. One of the things that all these young people had in common was they came from backgrounds of abuse, neglect and violence. Many of them had no one to call father. And all of them felt their lives were hopeless.\nI believe we have to stop being a nation content to spend as much as $50,000 a year to keep a young person in prison for life – when can spend $10,000 a year to give them Head Start, Early Start, Smart Start, the best possible start in life.\nI've said it before, and I'll say it again, this is the most important election of our lifetime. Our health care is on the line. Our jobs are on the line. Our children's future is on the line. America's role in the world is on the line. Our empowerment is on the line.\nThat is why we can not accept a repeat of 2000. This November, thanks to the efforts of the NAACP, the National Urban League and heightened vigilance across the nation, we are not only going to make sure that every vote counts; we're going to make sure that every single vote is counted.\nWe learned our lesson in 2000, and I add my voice to those who have vowed: never again.\nBut this election is more in your hands more than in mine. Over the next four months, we need you to help register voters and get them to the polls.\nWe can provide a new direction for America if we remember that in all the great movements for civil rights and equal rights, the environment and economic justice for all, we have come together as one America to give life to our highest ideals.\nMy friends, the America we believe in is calling us to service once again, and we must answer.\nThe great poet Langston Hughes put it this way:\nLet America be America again...Let it be the dream it used to be...for those whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain, whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain must bring back our mighty dream again.\nWith your help, in 2004, we can...we must...we will...bring back our mighty dream again.\nThank you and God bless you all.", "timestamp": "2004-07-22", "title": "Remarks to the 2004 National Urban League Conference in Detroit"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29713", "text": "Today, we're setting off on a journey that begins here at my birthplace and will end in Boston at America's birthplace. The next time I'm back this way it'll be official: I'll be your nominee for president of the United States.\nFrom there, we're off to the White House and to an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world. An America where the values of family, faith, and service aren't just words on a page, they're the values we live by and the choices we make.\nI'm so glad to be joined here this morning by my family, Teresa, Alex, Vanessa, Chris, and Andre – and to be standing with the next Vice President of the United States, John Edwards and his wonderful wife Elizabeth!\nFor the last two weeks, I've been lucky to have two Edwards on board helping make decisions, planning campaign stops, giving political advice – from both a male and female perspective. But enough about Jack and Emma Claire!\nI also want to take a minute to recognize all the veterans that came out this afternoon. Thank you for your service and for being here today. I can't think of a better band of brothers to help me out on this campaign!\nNow, we're starting with you Colorado! But when we leave here today, we're heading east, blazing America's freedom trail all the way to Boston. Tomorrow we're heading to Iowa to thank the voters who gave me a hearing when few thought I had a chance. Then it's off to Ohio and Florida, where we're going to see that this time around not only will every vote count, but every single vote will be counted.\nAnd then we're going to a Virginia naval base to show our unwavering support for an America with the strongest military in the world ... for an America that's respected and not just feared ... and for all the American soldiers standing a post around the world. Then it's off to Philadelphia where we first declared our independence. And then to Boston, where we're going to make another revolutionary stand for America.\nBut for me, it's only right to start this journey at the place that gave me my start. As you can imagine, this city holds a special place in my heart. When my father was a pilot in World War II, I was born at Fitzsimmons Army Hospital in Aurora, not too far from where we are today. Back then, you could actually look out the window of the hospital and see the dome of the capitol building. Now, I'm not one to read into things, but guess which wing of the hospital the maternity ward was in? Yup, ladies and gentlemen, you got it. I'm not making this up. I was born in the West Wing!\nThe word Aurora literally means \"dawn.\" And just spending a few minutes here in Colorado, it's easy to tell why the sun is always rising on Aurora. When America moved west, the town quickly became known as the Gateway to the Rockies, and not because Colfax ran from East Aurora through the foothills. It was the people in Aurora that made the difference. Their deep faith, their strong sense of community, and their hopeful confidence that America's best days were still ahead. I guess it's no surprise that some people said that Aurora had the longest Main Street in America.\nIn many ways, Aurora today is living proof of the limitless possibilities of progress. Fitzsimmons is now a cutting-edge medical facility for treatment, research, and teaching. Since World War II, this small town of 3,000 has become a thriving city of 300,000. Yet the people here in Aurora have never lost their Main Street values and their boundless sense of optimism. I don't know, maybe it's something in the drinking water, but I can tell you, even though I only spent a little time here, I've always been proud that I have some roots in the West.\nI remember my father telling me stories about his time here and about his years in the Army Air Corps. He helped me understand at an early age that we are all put on this earth for something greater than ourselves – and that's something my mother taught me, too. She led me when I was a Cub Scout and was proud of her years as a Girl Scout leader.\nThrough the power of their example, they both taught me that the most fundamental values in life is service to others. During the war, my mother wrote to my father, \"You have no idea of the ways in which one can be useful right now. There's something for everyone to do.\" My mother's words ring just as true today as they did fifty years ago. There's something for everyone to do, there's so much work to be done. That's why I'm here. That's why I'm running for president. And that's why in six days I'm going to take your hopes and dreams with me to Boston and we're going to build a stronger America.\nSo many Americans today are living up to the responsibility of service – when they swear a Scout oath, help out in a hospital or homeless shelter, or tutor in a local school. Others are on the front lines, whether that's in our military overseas, or in our police or fire departments here at home.\nPeople like Ann Deas from Denver who's here with us this morning. Ann volunteers at the Children's Hospital downtown, where she cheers up sick kids. And people like David King, who signed up for AmeriCorps as a teacher in a hard-pressed neighborhood because he wanted to give something back to his country. David knows that his students aren't asking for any guarantees in life – they're only asking for the tools they need to fulfill their own potential. The work that both Ann and David do shows that each of us has the potential to make the world just a little bit better.\nBelieve it or not, in the last week alone, more than 20,000 Americans like them have written into our campaign to tell us their own stories of service. Each of them is making a difference in their communities and each of them is making our country stronger.\nThat's what America's all about.\nSo we all have a responsibility to serve. We all have to do our part. But it's up to us to give everyone who can contribute the chance to do so.\nRight now, for too many Americans, the skyrocketing cost of college is standing between their commitment and their capacity to serve. As president, I will offer half a million Americans a year an opportunity to give back to our country. And I'll do so, by giving four years of college tuition to those who give two years of service to America. For some, that means teaching kids to read. For others, it's keeping our parks clean or protecting our homeland.\nOthers will serve while they're in college, dedicating afternoons and weekends to helping children learn to read and write. And we'll invest $10 million a year in a Citizen Patriots Fund, to support a new generation of social entrepreneurs who are engaged in new and creative ways to serve America.\nThe Patriots Fund will also help those who've served in our military or Peace Corps abroad, serve in their communities when they come home. I want all Americans to have the same chance to contribute that I did when I returned from Vietnam.\nNational service is an important step to building a stronger America. But we also have to embrace the other values that bring us together as one America: faith and family, hard work and responsibility, and opportunity for all.\nDuring the course of this campaign, I've met young people who want nothing more than to be able to find a job in the place they were raised.\nI've met steelworkers, mineworkers and autoworkers who are now laid off workers and watched their jobs shipped overseas. They can't afford their health insurance and they don't know where to turn.\nI've spent time with seniors who have worked for a lifetime but can't pay for their medicines and can hardly make ends meet.\nAnd I've talked with parents full of hope and ambition for their children, but they're worried that they won't be able to afford to send their kids to college.\nThese Americans deserve a chance to have their dreams fulfilled not broken before their eyes. They deserve leadership that fights as hard for their jobs as they do for their own.\nLet me tell you what John Edwards and I value.\nWe value good-paying jobs that actually let our families hope for their children, save for their future, and actually get ahead. An America where the middle class is not being squeezed, but doing better.\nAnd that's why we have an economic plan that will revitalize manufacturing, put America back to work, and create new, good-paying jobs.\nWe value an America that exports products, not jobs – and we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own job.\nThat's why we have a plan to close the tax loopholes that pay companies to ship our jobs overseas. Instead, we will reward companies that keep good paying jobs where they belong – in America.\nWe value American workers and we will give them a fair playing field. Because if you give American workers a fair playing field, there's no one in the world that the American worker can't compete against.\nWe value giving all our children a first-rate education, with smaller classes and better paid teachers, and opening the doors of college to all Americans.\nAnd that's why we have a plan to invest in our schools, pay our teachers what they deserve, and cuts the cost of college.\nWe value affordable health care that is a right, not a privilege for every American. In four years, four million people have lost their health insurance. Your premiums are up. Your co-payments are up. Your deductibles are hitting record levels. We can do better.\nWe have a plan to get the waste, the greed, and the paperwork out of our health care system and save families up to $1,000 a year on their premiums.\nWe value an America that is truly free and independent of Mideast oil.\nWe have a plan to invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future, so that no young American in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East.\nAnd we value a strong military and strong alliances, so no young American is ever put in harm's way because we insisted on going it alone.\nIn our Administration, we'll never go to war because we want to, we'll only go to war because we have to. And we'll stand by our soldiers when they go off to war and stand by them when they return.\nThese aren't Democratic values. They're not Republican values. They're American values. They're the shared values we believe in. And that's what we're going to Boston to fight for. Because if we honor our values, we can build an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.\nMy friends, this is the most important election of our lifetime. Our health care is on the line. Our jobs are on the line. Our children's future is on the line. America's role in the world is on the line.\nWe can provide a new direction for America if we remember that in all the great movements for civil rights and equal rights, the environment and economic justice for all, we have come together as one America to give life to our highest ideals.\nFor the next three months, John Edwards and I are going to work day in and day out, beginning right here in Colorado, with all of you.\nFor the next six days, we're going to travel to other great places in America to talk about our hopes and vision for our country. From the small towns in Iowa to the beach towns in Florida ... from the ships of Virginia to the public squares of Philadelphia, we're going to blaze America's freedom trail. And, on Thursday, we're going to wind up in Boston, where the next journey will begin -- the journey that will take us to the White House on November 2nd.\nMy friends, this election is in your hands more than ours. Talk to your friends, talk to your neighbors, knock on their doors, enlist in our cause.\nWe can do this. We're the can-do people. We're the optimists. We just need to lift ourselves up, reach for the next dream, and look to the next horizon. What the people in Colorado have always known is still true: America's best days are still ahead of us.\nThank you and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-07-23", "title": "Remarks in Aurora, Colorado"}

This is John Kerry.\nToday, we're blazing across America's Freedom Trail on the way to Boston, the place where freedom and democracy were born 228 years ago. On Friday, we began this journey in Aurora, Colorado, the place where I was born... let's say definitely less than 228 years ago.\nThis journey – this campaign – is about celebrating the spirit and the values that built America. It's about the sense of service that led my father to sign up with the Army Air Corps in Colorado during WWII, and the can-do optimism that pressed Lewis and Clark westward after Sioux City. It's about the rising opportunity once provided by a bustling Ohio economy, and the limitless possibility launched with each Cape Canaveral space shuttle. And it's about supporting the soldier standing post at a Virginia naval base, and giving the freedom-loving Philadelphian a country that is once again looked upon with respect and admiration by its neighbors.\nMost of all, for John Edwards and I, this campaign is about listening and learning from Americans who believe in their hearts that tomorrow can be better than today. Americans who are ready to build a stronger America that is once again respected in the world.\nWe'll have covered a lot of ground by the time we get to Boston on Thursday. Yet, just like the fight for our freedom, Boston is where our journey truly begins.\nFollowing the convention, John, Elizabeth, Teresa and I will set out with family and friends on a cross-country tour – from sea to shining sea – to bring our message of hope and optimism to every corner of America.\nFrom Main Street steps to front porch visits, we will show Americans that John Edwards and I have the vision and the values to build a stronger America\nValues are not just talk. They're what we live. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. And we intend to criss-cross this country reminding people that what matters is not the narrow values that divide – but the shared values that have always united every American: faith and family, strength and service, responsibility and opportunity for all.\nLet me tell you what John Edwards and I value.\nWe value good-paying jobs that actually let American workers get ahead. We value affordable health care that is a right, not a privilege, for every American. We value an America that is free and independent of Mideast oil. And we value a strong military and strong alliances, so that America never has to go to war because it wants to, but only because we have to.\nThese aren't Democratic values. They're not Republican values. They're American values. They're what we believe in. They're who we are. And if we honor them, we can build an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.\nThis is the most important election of our lifetime. Our health care is on the line. Our jobs are on the line. Our children's future is on the line. America's role in the world is on the line.\nWe can provide a new direction for America if we remember that in all the great movements for civil rights and equal rights, the environment and economic justice for all, we have always come together as one America to give life to our highest ideals.\nWe're taking this trip with the hope that we can begin a new conversation in this country. That we can lift ourselves up, reach for the possible, and look to the horizon once more.\nJohn Edwards and I will not rest along this journey until we build the future of our dreams, for all Americans. Because we believe in the possibility of tomorrow. We believe that America's best days lie ahead. And, like all of you, we believe in America.\nThanks for listening and we'll see you out on the trail.", "timestamp": "2004-07-24", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation from Sioux City, Iowa"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25971", "text": "I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.\nWe are here tonight because we love our country.\nWe are proud of what America is and what it can become.\nMy fellow Americans: we are here tonight united in one simple purpose: to make America stronger at home and respected in the world.\nA great American novelist wrote that you can't go home again. He could not have imagined this evening. Tonight, I am home. Home where my public life began and those who made it possible live. Home where our nation's history was written in blood, idealism, and hope. Home where my parents showed me the values of family, faith, and country.\nThank you, all of you, for a welcome home I will never forget.\nI wish my parents could share this moment. They went to their rest in the last few years, but their example, their inspiration, their gift of open eyes, open mind, and endless world are bigger and more lasting than any words.\nI was born in Colorado, in Fitzsimmons Army Hospital, when my dad was a pilot in World War II. Now, I'm not one to read into things, but guess which wing of the hospital the maternity ward was in? I'm not making this up. I was born in the West Wing!\nMy mother was the rock of our family as so many mothers are. She stayed up late to help me do my homework. She sat by my bed when I was sick, and she answered the questions of a child who, like all children, found the world full of wonders and mysteries.\nShe was my den mother when I was a Cub Scout and she was so proud of her fifty year pin as a Girl Scout leader. She gave me her passion for the environment. She taught me to see trees as the cathedrals of nature. And by the power of her example, she showed me that we can and must finish the march toward full equality for all women in our country.\nMy dad did the things that a boy remembers. He gave me my first model airplane, my first baseball mitt and my first bicycle. He also taught me that we are here for something bigger than ourselves; he lived out the responsibilities and sacrifices of the greatest generation to whom we owe so much.\nWhen I was a young man, he was in the State Department, stationed in Berlin when it and the world were divided between democracy and communism. I have unforgettable memories of being a kid mesmerized by the British, French, and American troops, each of them guarding their own part of the city, and Russians standing guard on the stark line separating East from West. On one occasion, I rode my bike into Soviet East Berlin. And when I proudly told my dad, he promptly grounded me.\nBut what I learned has stayed with me for a lifetime. I saw how different life was on different sides of the same city. I saw the fear in the eyes of people who were not free. I saw the gratitude of people toward the United States for all that we had done. I felt goose bumps as I got off a military train and heard the Army band strike up \"Stars and Stripes Forever.\" I learned what it meant to be America at our best. I learned the pride of our freedom. And I am determined now to restore that pride to all who look to America.\nMine were greatest generation parents. And as I thank them, we all join together to thank that whole generation for making America strong, for winning World War II, winning the Cold War, and for the great gift of service which brought America fifty years of peace and prosperity.\nMy parents inspired me to serve, and when I was a junior in high school, John Kennedy called my generation to service. It was the beginning of a great journey – a time to march for civil rights, for voting rights, for the environment, for women, and for peace. We believed we could change the world. And you know what? We did.\nBut we're not finished. The journey isn't complete. The march isn't over. The promise isn't perfected. Tonight, we're setting out again. And together, we're going to write the next great chapter of America's story.\nWe have it in our power to change the world again. But only if we're true to our ideals – and that starts by telling the truth to the American people. That is my first pledge to you tonight. As President, I will restore trust and credibility to the White House.\nI ask you to judge me by my record: As a young prosecutor, I fought for victim's rights and made prosecuting violence against women a priority. When I came to the Senate, I broke with many in my own party to vote for a balanced budget, because I thought it was the right thing to do. I fought to put a 100,000 cops on the street.\nAnd then I reached across the aisle to work with John McCain, to find the truth about our POW's and missing in action, and to finally make peace with Vietnam.\nI will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war. I will have a Vice President who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws. I will have a Secretary of Defense who will listen to the best advice of our military leaders. And I will appoint an Attorney General who actually upholds the Constitution of the United States.\nMy fellow Americans, this is the most important election of our lifetime. The stakes are high. We are a nation at war – a global war on terror against an enemy unlike any we have ever known before. And here at home, wages are falling, health care costs are rising, and our great middle class is shrinking. People are working weekends; they're working two jobs, three jobs, and they're still not getting ahead.\nWe're told that outsourcing jobs is good for America. We're told that new jobs that pay $9,000 less than the jobs that have been lost is the best we can do. They say this is the best economy we've ever had. And they say that anyone who thinks otherwise is a pessimist. Well, here is our answer: There is nothing more pessimistic than saying America can't do better.\nWe can do better and we will. We're the optimists. For us, this is a country of the future. We're the can do people. And let's not forget what we did in the 1990s. We balanced the budget. We paid down the debt. We created 23 million new jobs. We lifted millions out of poverty and we lifted the standard of living for the middle class. We just need to believe in ourselves – and we can do it again.\nSo tonight, in the city where America's freedom began, only a few blocks from where the sons and daughters of liberty gave birth to our nation – here tonight, on behalf of a new birth of freedom – on behalf of the middle class who deserve a champion, and those struggling to join it who deserve a fair shot – for the brave men and women in uniform who risk their lives every day and the families who pray for their return – for all those who believe our best days are ahead of us – for all of you – with great faith in the American people, I accept your nomination for President of the United States.\nI am proud that at my side will be a running mate whose life is the story of the American dream and who's worked every day to make that dream real for all Americans – Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. And his wonderful wife Elizabeth and their family. This son of a mill worker is ready to lead – and next January, Americans will be proud to have a fighter for the middle class to succeed Dick Cheney as Vice President of the United States.\nAnd what can I say about Teresa? She has the strongest moral compass of anyone I know. She's down to earth, nurturing, courageous, wise and smart. She speaks her mind and she speaks the truth, and I love her for that, too. And that's why America will embrace her as the next First Lady of the United States.\nFor Teresa and me, no matter what the future holds or the past has given us, nothing will ever mean as much as our children. We love them not just for who they are and what they've become, but for being themselves, making us laugh, holding our feet to the fire, and never letting me get away with anything. Thank you, Andre, Alex, Chris, Vanessa, and John.\nAnd in this journey, I am accompanied by an extraordinary band of brothers led by that American hero, a patriot named Max Cleland. Our band of brothers doesn't march together because of who we are as veterans, but because of what we learned as soldiers. We fought for this nation because we loved it and we came back with the deep belief that every day is extra. We may be a little older now, we may be a little grayer, but we still know how to fight for our country.\nAnd standing with us in that fight are those who shared with me the long season of the primary campaign: Carol Moseley Braun, General Wesley Clark, Howard Dean, Dick Gephardt, Bob Graham, Dennis Kucinich, Joe Lieberman and Al Sharpton.\nTo all of you, I say thank you for teaching me and testing me – but mostly, we say thank you for standing up for our country and giving us the unity to move America forward.\nMy fellow Americans, the world tonight is very different from the world of four years ago. But I believe the American people are more than equal to the challenge.\nRemember the hours after September 11th, when we came together as one to answer the attack against our homeland. We drew strength when our firefighters ran up the stairs and risked their lives, so that others might live. When rescuers rushed into smoke and fire at the Pentagon. When the men and women of Flight 93 sacrificed themselves to save our nation's Capitol. When flags were hanging from front porches all across America, and strangers became friends. It was the worst day we have ever seen, but it brought out the best in all of us.\nI am proud that after September 11th all our people rallied to President Bush's call for unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats. There were no Republicans. There were only Americans. How we wish it had stayed that way.\nNow I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities – and I do – because some issues just aren't all that simple. Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so. Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesn't make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so.\nAs President, I will ask hard questions and demand hard evidence. I will immediately reform the intelligence system – so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics. And as President, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: the United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to.\nI know what kids go through when they are carrying an M-16 in a dangerous place and they can't tell friend from foe. I know what they go through when they're out on patrol at night and they don't know what's coming around the next bend. I know what it's like to write letters home telling your family that everything's all right when you're not sure that's true.\nAs President, I will wage this war with the lessons I learned in war. Before you go to battle, you have to be able to look a parent in the eye and truthfully say: \"I tried everything possible to avoid sending your son or daughter into harm's way. But we had no choice. We had to protect the American people, fundamental American values from a threat that was real and imminent.\" So lesson one, this is the only justification for going to war.\nAnd on my first day in office, I will send a message to every man and woman in our armed forces: You will never be asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace.\nI know what we have to do in Iraq. We need a President who has the credibility to bring our allies to our side and share the burden, reduce the cost to American taxpayers, and reduce the risk to American soldiers. That's the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home.\nHere is the reality: that won't happen until we have a president who restores America's respect and leadership -- so we don't have to go it alone in the world.\nAnd we need to rebuild our alliances, so we can get the terrorists before they get us.\nI defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as President. Let there be no mistake: I will never hesitate to use force when it is required. Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response. I will never give any nation or international institution a veto over our national security. And I will build a stronger American military.\nWe will add 40,000 active duty troops – not in Iraq, but to strengthen American forces that are now overstretched, overextended, and under pressure. We will double our special forces to conduct anti-terrorist operations. We will provide our troops with the newest weapons and technology to save their lives – and win the battle. And we will end the backdoor draft of National Guard and reservists.\nTo all who serve in our armed forces today, I say, help is on the way.\nAs President, I will fight a smarter, more effective war on terror. We will deploy every tool in our arsenal: our economic as well as our military might; our principles as well as our firepower.\nIn these dangerous days there is a right way and a wrong way to be strong. Strength is more than tough words. After decades of experience in national security, I know the reach of our power and I know the power of our ideals.\nWe need to make America once again a beacon in the world. We need to be looked up to and not just feared.\nWe need to lead a global effort against nuclear proliferation – to keep the most dangerous weapons in the world out of the most dangerous hands in the world.\nWe need a strong military and we need to lead strong alliances. And then, with confidence and determination, we will be able to tell the terrorists: You will lose and we will win. The future doesn't belong to fear; it belongs to freedom.\nAnd the front lines of this battle are not just far away – they're right here on our shores, at our airports, and potentially in any town or city. Today, our national security begins with homeland security. The 9-11 Commission has given us a path to follow, endorsed by Democrats, Republicans, and the 9-11 families. As President, I will not evade or equivocate; I will immediately implement the recommendations of that commission. We shouldn't be letting ninety-five percent of container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected. We shouldn't be leaving our nuclear and chemical plants without enough protection. And we shouldn't be opening firehouses in Baghdad and closing them down in the United States of America.\nAnd tonight, we have an important message for those who question the patriotism of Americans who offer a better direction for our country. Before wrapping themselves in the flag and shutting their eyes and ears to the truth, they should remember what America is really all about. They should remember the great idea of freedom for which so many have given their lives. Our purpose now is to reclaim democracy itself. We are here to affirm that when Americans stand up and speak their minds and say America can do better, that is not a challenge to patriotism; it is the heart and soul of patriotism.\nYou see that flag up there. We call her Old Glory. The stars and stripes forever. I fought under that flag, as did so many of you here and all across our country. That flag flew from the gun turret right behind my head. It was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind. It draped the caskets of men I served with and friends I grew up with. For us, that flag is the most powerful symbol of who we are and what we believe in. Our strength. Our diversity. Our love of country. All that makes America both great and good.\nThat flag doesn't belong to any president. It doesn't belong to any ideology and it doesn't belong to any political party. It belongs to all the American people.\nMy fellow citizens, elections are about choices. And choices are about values. In the end, it's not just policies and programs that matter; the president who sits at that desk must be guided by principle.\nFor four years, we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values spoken without actions taken are just slogans. Values are not just words. They're what we live by. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. And it is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families.\nYou don't value families by kicking kids out of after school programs and taking cops off our streets, so that Enron can get another tax break.\nWe believe in the family value of caring for our children and protecting the neighborhoods where they walk and play.\nAnd that is the choice in this election.\nYou don't value families by denying real prescription drug coverage to seniors, so big drug companies can get another windfall.\nWe believe in the family value expressed in one of the oldest Commandments: \"Honor thy father and thy mother.\" As President, I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. And together, we will make sure that senior citizens never have to cut their pills in half because they can't afford life-saving medicine.\nAnd that is the choice in this election.\nYou don't value families if you force them to take up a collection to buy body armor for a son or daughter in the service, if you deny veterans health care, or if you tell middle class families to wait for a tax cut, so that the wealthiest among us can get even more.\nWe believe in the value of doing what's right for everyone in the American family.\nAnd that is the choice in this election.\nWe believe that what matters most is not narrow appeals masquerading as values, but the shared values that show the true face of America. Not narrow appeals that divide us, but shared values that unite us. Family and faith. Hard work and responsibility. Opportunity for all – so that every child, every parent, every worker has an equal shot at living up to their God-given potential.\nWhat does it mean in America today when Dave McCune, a steel worker I met in Canton, Ohio, saw his job sent overseas and the equipment in his factory literally unbolted, crated up, and shipped thousands of miles away along with that job? What does it mean when workers I've met had to train their foreign replacements?\nAmerica can do better. So tonight we say: help is on the way.\nWhat does it mean when Mary Ann Knowles, a woman with breast cancer I met in New Hampshire, had to keep working day after day right through her chemotherapy, no matter how sick she felt, because she was terrified of losing her family's health insurance.\nAmerica can do better. And help is on the way.\nWhat does it mean when Deborah Kromins from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania works and saves all her life only to find out that her pension has disappeared into thin air – and the executive who looted it has bailed out on a golden parachute?\nAmerica can do better. And help is on the way.\nWhat does it mean when twenty five percent of the children in Harlem have asthma because of air pollution?\nAmerica can do better. And help is on the way.\nWhat does it mean when people are huddled in blankets in the cold, sleeping in Lafayette Park on the doorstep of the White House itself – and the number of families living in poverty has risen by three million in the last four years?\nAmerica can do better. And help is on the way.\nAnd so we come here tonight to ask: Where is the conscience of our country?\nI'll tell you where it is: it's in rural and small town America; it's in urban neighborhoods and suburban main streets; it's alive in the people I've met in every part of this land. It's bursting in the hearts of Americans who are determined to give our country back its values and its truth.\nWe value jobs that pay you more not less than you earned before. We value jobs where, when you put in a week's work, you can actually pay your bills, provide for your children, and lift up the quality of your life. We value an America where the middle class is not being squeezed, but doing better.\nSo here is our economic plan to build a stronger America:\nFirst, new incentives to revitalize manufacturing.\nSecond, investment in technology and innovation that will create the good-paying jobs of the future.\nThird, close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas. Instead, we will reward companies that create and keep good paying jobs where they belong – in the good old U.S.A.\nWe value an America that exports products, not jobs – and we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own job.\nNext, we will trade and compete in the world. But our plan calls for a fair playing field – because if you give the American worker a fair playing field, there's nobody in the world the American worker can't compete against.\nAnd we're going to return to fiscal responsibility because it is the foundation of our economic strength. Our plan will cut the deficit in half in four years by ending tax giveaways that are nothing more than corporate welfare – and will make government live by the rule that every family has to follow: pay as you go.\nAnd let me tell you what we won't do: we won't raise taxes on the middle class. You've heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will cut middle class taxes. I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in job creation, health care and education.\nOur education plan for a stronger America sets high standards and demands accountability from parents, teachers, and schools. It provides for smaller class sizes and treats teachers like the professionals they are. And it gives a tax credit to families for each and every year of college.\nWhen I was a prosecutor, I met young kids who were in trouble, abandoned by adults. And as President, I am determined that we stop being a nation content to spend $50,000 a year to keep a young person in prison for the rest of their life – when we could invest $10,000 to give them Head Start, Early Start, Smart Start, the best possible start in life.\nAnd we value health care that's affordable and accessible for all Americans.\nSince 2000, four million people have lost their health insurance. Millions more are struggling to afford it.\nYou know what's happening. Your premiums, your co-payments, your deductibles have all gone through the roof.\nOur health care plan for a stronger America cracks down on the waste, greed, and abuse in our health care system and will save families up to $1,000 a year on their premiums. You'll get to pick your own doctor – and patients and doctors, not insurance company bureaucrats, will make medical decisions. Under our plan, Medicare will negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. And all Americans will be able to buy less expensive prescription drugs from countries like Canada.\nThe story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans. But you know what, it's not the story of senators and members of Congress. Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. Well, I'm here to say, your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, D.C.\nAnd when I'm President, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected – it is a right for all Americans.\nWe value an America that controls its own destiny because it's finally and forever independent of Mideast oil. What does it mean for our economy and our national security when we only have three percent of the world's oil reserves, yet we rely on foreign countries for fifty-three percent of what we consume?\nI want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation – not the Saudi royal family.\nAnd our energy plan for a stronger America will invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future -- so that no young American in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East.\nI've told you about our plans for the economy, for education, for health care, for energy independence. I want you to know more about them. So now I'm going to say something that Franklin Roosevelt could never have said in his acceptance speech: go to johnkerry.com.\nI want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States.\nMy friends, the high road may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And that's why Republicans and Democrats must make this election a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks. This is our time to reject the kind of politics calculated to divide race from race, group from group, region from region. Maybe some just see us divided into red states and blue states, but I see us as one America – red, white, and blue. And when I am President, the government I lead will enlist people of talent, Republicans as well as Democrats, to find the common ground – so that no one who has something to contribute will be left on the sidelines.\nAnd let me say it plainly: in that cause, and in this campaign, we welcome people of faith. America is not us and them. I think of what Ron Reagan said of his father a few weeks ago, and I want to say this to you tonight: I don't wear my own faith on my sleeve. But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side. And whatever our faith, one belief should bind us all: The measure of our character is our willingness to give of ourselves for others and for our country.\nThese aren't Democratic values. These aren't Republican values. They're American values. We believe in them. They're who we are. And if we honor them, if we believe in ourselves, we can build an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.\nSo much promise stretches before us. Americans have always reached for the impossible, looked to the next horizon, and asked: What if?\nTwo young bicycle mechanics from Dayton asked what if this airplane could take off at Kitty Hawk? It did that and changed the world forever. A young president asked what if we could go to the moon in ten years? And now we're exploring the solar system and the stars themselves. A young generation of entrepreneurs asked, what if we could take all the information in a library and put it on a little chip the size of a fingernail? We did and that too changed the world forever.\nAnd now it's our time to ask: What if?\nWhat if we find a breakthrough to cure Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's and AIDS? What if we have a president who believes in science, so we can unleash the wonders of discovery like stem cell research to treat illness and save millions of lives?\nWhat if we do what adults should do – and make sure all our children are safe in the afternoons after school? And what if we have a leadership that's as good as the American dream – so that bigotry and hatred never again steal the hope and future of any American?\nI learned a lot about these values on that gunboat patrolling the Mekong Delta with young Americans who came from places as different as Iowa and Oregon, Arkansas, Florida and California. No one cared where we went to school. No one cared about our race or our backgrounds. We were literally all in the same boat. We looked out, one for the other – and we still do.\nThat is the kind of America I will lead as President – an America where we are all in the same boat.\nNever has there been a more urgent moment for Americans to step up and define ourselves. I will work my heart out. But, my fellow citizens, the outcome is in your hands more than mine.\nIt is time to reach for the next dream. It is time to look to the next horizon. For America, the hope is there. The sun is rising. Our best days are still to come.\nGoodnight, God bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-07-29", "title": "Address Accepting the Presidential Nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Boston"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29716", "text": "Thank you for that gracious introduction. As you know, right after our convention, John Edwards and I set off on a journey to meet face to face with people all across this country – to share our plan for a stronger America at home, and a more respected America in the world. But more importantly, to listen to what people have to say. And today I'm honored to take a little bit of a detour on our westward journey -- because I want to hear your ideas, your concerns and your hopes for the future.\nAs Americans, we are living in a time transformed by 9/11. Ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan – and repeated increases in threat levels – are constant reminders that our soldiers and our homeland are still in harm's way. As journalists, you are operating in that new world. Yet I also believe enduring principles apply here: We won't win this struggle by hiding or ignoring the facts. You have a part to play – not as partisans, but as truth-tellers. Because the key to victory in the war on terror is not just the power of our arms, but the power of our ideals.\nThe information, the commentary, the debate that you bring to the eyes and ears of America – and the world – are critical to an informed public, critical to making the right decisions, and critical to correcting the wrong ones.\nWe are in this fight because we are a democracy. We must win it as a democracy. And one of the most powerful weapons in the arsenal of our democracy is the freedom of the press.\nYou have another great power and privilege in this decisive time. As Americans prepare to decide the direction of our free society – not just for the next four years, but perhaps for decades to come, you will report and referee the arena of a great national campaign. You know the questions people are asking because you hear them everyday:\nWho has the right plan to win the war on terror and make America safe? Who has a real plan for a stronger America that will create new good paying jobs? Who has a realistic plan to hold down health care costs – and open up access to health care for all Americans? Who is being straightforward about taxes – about the need to cut taxes for the middle class, and rollback an unaffordable tax cut for individuals who make over $200,000 a year – so we can invest in health care and education, and cut the deficit in half in four years? And, above all, who is truly committed to bridging the divides in this country that continue to separate race from race, group from group, region from region?\nThese are questions that are important to communities of color and to every American. As the motto of Frederick Douglas' North Star newspaper proclaimed in 1848, \"Right is of no sex--Truth is of no color--God is the Father of us all, and we are all Brethen.\"\nWe're really going to unite the country -- we're going to put in place the policies that will bring us together and move America forward.\nWe're being told this week, again and again, that we've turned corner. We're being told to look at the results. I agree. Let's look at the record. Have we turned the corner when forty-four million Americans don't even have basic health care coverage? Have we turned the corner when we've lost nearly 1.8 million private sector jobs? Have we turned the corner when we're told that outsourcing is good for America – and the new jobs that are being created pay $9,000 less than the jobs that have been lost?\nMy friends, just saying you've turned the corner, doesn't make it so. Slogans don't matter. Results matter. Results are what make the difference in people's lives.\nWe believe America, and all Americans, can do better.\nOur plans for America embrace all Americans. Of course, I am also all too aware – how could you live in America and not be aware? – of the special challenges facing people of color. Fifty years after Brown v Board of Education, in too many painful ways, America is still a house divided; too many Americans continue to be separate and unequal in health status, educational achievement, and living standards.\nDespite all the legal gains – and that journey isn't finished yet either – America can't be fully America when millions still face barriers to living up to their God-given potential. How, for example, can we accept a situation where 50% of African American men in New York City are without a job? How can we accept the fact that one of every five Asian Americans attempting to buy or rent a home faces discrimination?\nThis is unworthy of a nation that values equality, and we have to change it.\nI believe with all my heart that America can do better and we will. And the best way to lift up those who have been left out is to honor the shared values that unite us and show the true face of America: Faith and family. Hard work and responsibility. Opportunity for all – so that every child, every parent, every worker, has an equal shot at living up to their God-given potential.\nThat is the heart and soul of my plan for a stronger America. The details of that plan were just released in book form earlier this week. The book is detailed and clear. I hope everything about it is straightforward; I know the title is. It's simply called, Our Plan for America. And you can download the entire volume at JohnKerry.com.\nNow, I am not going to turn this into a John Kerry book reading, but let me highlight just some of what's in the book.\nOur plan has three basic parts:\nThe first part focuses on our security. It lays out a strategy to strengthen our military, build and lead strong alliances, and reform our intelligence system. It sets out a path to win the peace in Iraq – and to get the terrorists before they get us. To strengthen our homeland security, we will protect our ports, secure our chemical and nuclear power plants, and support our police officers, firefighters and EMT's. You know, color coded warnings aren't enough if we continue to let 95% of container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected.\nThe second part of the book focuses on expanding economic opportunity. It offers a real plan to keep and create good paying jobs in America. To end tax breaks that reward companies for shipping American jobs overseas. To revitalize manufacturing – and encourage investment in the new industries of the future.\nAt the same time, we will restore fiscal discipline not only by rolling back the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, but by closing tax loopholes that are nothing more than corporate welfare – and making government live by the same rule that our families do: pay as you go.\nThird, our plan focuses on strengthening families. John and I don't want working families to just get by. We want them to get ahead. That's why 98 percent of Americans will pay lower taxes under our plan -- with additional tax breaks to help them cover health care, child care, and college.\nIn the past week, our opponents haven't offered a plan of their own, or a defense of their record. Instead, after four long years, all we've been given is a new slogan. In the past week, we've suddenly been told again and again that America has turned the corner. Well, you know, the last president who used that slogan – who told us prosperity was just around the corner was Herbert Hoover during the Great Depression.\nWe've been called pessimists for pointing out the facts, and being honest about the struggles of hard-working families. Here's my answer to that: there is nothing more pessimistic than saying that America can't do better.\nYou know and I know that just saying we're turning the corner on the war on terror, on jobs and opportunity and on building one America doesn't make it so. We have a lot of work to do.\nThe vision and values that John Edwards and I have set out in Our Plan for America can bring our country together again. We can build stronger communities. We can secure equality and strengthen opportunity. We can demand and support responsibility from all. For us, these values are not just words. They're about results. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. Los valores son mas que palabras. Values are more than just words.\nThey're about good jobs for our families...good schools for our children...good prescription drug coverage for our parents and a nation that is coming together, not splitting apart.\nJohn Edwards and I have a record to stand on and we have a real agenda to make America better.\nLet me tell you what values mean to me and John Edwards:\nValues mean having an opportunity agenda for America. That means bringing capital, small business opportunities and job creation to all of our communities – especially our central cities and the surrounding metropolitan areas. It means providing adequate funding for homeland security and port security so that the people in our metropolitan areas are able move about freely, get to good jobs and live without fear.\nCreating opportunity also means creating good-paying jobs. More than a million Americans who were working three years ago have lost their jobs. African-American unemployment is now at 10 percent – double the rate for whites. And the new jobs finally being created pay an average of $9,000 less a year.\nWe have a plan to keep and create good paying jobs here at home. When I am president, no longer will American workers have to subsidize the loss of their own jobs.\nWe'll close tax loopholes that pay companies to move our jobs overseas – and we'll reward companies that create jobs right here in the good old USA. And we'll bring fairness back to the American workplace.\nValues also mean giving all our children a first-rate education. Today, we see two school systems in America: one for the well off and one for the left out. Too many children of color are being told they have to lift themselves up in schools that are literally falling down. For us, values mean opening the doors of opportunity to all our children.\nValues mean making health care affordable and accessible for all Americans. In the last four years, four million people have lost their health insurance. 44 million Americans don't have health insurance.\nThe truth is that nearly 60 percent of Hispanics and 43 percent of African Americans went without health coverage for all or part of the last two years. Today people of color are significantly more likely to suffer and die from diseases like cancer and asthma and AIDS and diabetes. And the life expectancy for Native Americans is 17 years shorter than it is for other Americans, largely because of poor health. America can do better than that.\nWhen I am in the White House we are going to stop being the only industrial nation on the face of the earth that doesn't understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected or the elected. Health care is a right for all Americans.\nWe've got a plan to get the waste and greed out of our health care system and help families save up to $1,000 on their premiums.\nAnd it means reaffirming the truth that America is now, and has always been, a nation of immigrants. Within the first 100 days of my administration, I will send Congress a reform bill that lets immigrants earn legalization and encourages family reunification, while protecting our borders in ways that are fairer and more effective.\nAs president, I will also restore respect for tribal sovereignty throughout the Executive Branch and re-open the doors to the White House to the first Americans. We understand the struggles our Native American brothers and sisters face. In addition to the health care crisis facing tribes, we also know that poverty is rising in America, and nowhere is it worse than on our reservations. To ensure that your voice is heard on these and other vital issues, I will appoint Native Americans to key positions in the White House and throughout my administration.\nAnd I will do my part to bring more diversity into the media. Right now people of color make up 32 percent of the nation's population but only 13 percent of daily newspaper staffs. And people of color represent only a tiny fraction of the number of editors, anchors, and executives at our nation's premier news organizations. Right now only 4.2 percent of radio stations and 1.5 percent of TV stations are owned by minorities.\nI look around at all the talent in this room and say to the management of these organizations, we can do better.\nAs president, I will expand opportunities for people of color in the media, by appointing FCC commissioners committed to enforcing equal employment and insuring that small and minority-owned broadcasters are not consolidated into extinction.\nThirty-nine years ago tomorrow, when Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, he said: \"Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote. Yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country, men and women are kept from voting simply because they are Negroes.\" My friends, the harsh fact now is that in the last election, more than one million African Americans were disenfranchised in one of the most tainted election in history. We can do better – and we have to. We have to see to it in November that every vote counts – and every vote is counted.\nAlong with shared opportunity we must also demand shared responsibility. All of us, from the President in the White House to people in their homes and schools and workplaces, have to be responsible for our actions. And we owe it to all the people who follow the law to hold accountable those who don't.\nThat begins with having a president who tells the truth to the American people. It means staying vigilant to ensure that every American company plays by the rules and does right by its workers and customers. And it means giving young people alternatives to gangs and gang violence by first sending them a strong message that the violence must stop, and if it doesn't, police and prosecutors will hold them accountable, period. But second, by sending young people a strong, clear message that there is another path, and if they are willing to take that path, we will be there with them – with job training, job opportunities, and drug treatment.\nShared opportunity. Shared responsibility. That is how we really make our country stronger and bring real hope, real help and real opportunity to all Americans.\nI want to thank you for doing your part every single day. No one in public life doesn't have some complaint, at some time, about the \"fourth estate.\" But your persistent vigilance makes us all better – and it makes you watchmen on the walls of liberty.\nI believe that this is the most important election of our lifetime. Everything is at stake. Your role in the next months is as important as any point in our shared history.\nYour questioning, your demands for honest answers, your reporting on our progress, and your holding us accountable for our promises, are an indispensable force in moving America forward. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to measure me by my results, not just my rhetoric, by my actions, not just my words. Results matter.\nLet's not forget the role that so many of your brothers and sisters in the media have played in exposing historic wrongs, lifting up communities of color and building one America.\nWhere would we be today if it were not for the stirring images of the civil rights movement captured for Life Magazine by the camera of Gordon Parks; or the searing war-time photojournalism of Nick Ut?\nWhere would we be without the pioneering word pictures painted by Ruben Salazar for the El Paso Herald Post and Los Angeles Times.\nWhere would we be without Carol Simpson, Frank del Olmo, Bernard Shaw, Ed Bradley or Max Robinson? Where would we be without the famed Native American historian and journalist, Arthur Caswell Parker, founder of American Indian Magazine, or Ignacio Lozano, founder of La Opinion?\nWhere would we be today without Unity 2004 and all of you?\nSo above all today, I thank you for all that you have done and all that you will do to help us become the America we were truly meant to be – the America whose best days are still to come. Thank you and now I will be happy to take questions...", "timestamp": "2004-08-05", "title": "Remarks at the UNITY 2004 Conference in Washington, DC"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29717", "text": "Good morning, this is John Kerry.\nThree years ago, the President enacted a far-reaching ban on stem cell research, shutting down some of the most promising work to prevent, treat and cure Alzheimers, Parkinsons, diabetes, AIDS and so many other life-threatening diseases.\nThose affected by this decision already mark so many hard anniversaries of their own. The day you get a call from a doctor when he brings you the results of a diagnosis and it makes your heart sink. Or the day that people told you that they tried everything possible to make you better – and now, you were all out of options. The day you said goodbye to someone you loved, and all the days that followed that were never quite the same. Marking today's anniversary only adds to the loss and the pain.\nRight now, more than 100 million Americans suffer from illnesses that one day could be wiped away with stem-cell therapy. Stem cells could replace damaged heart cells or cells destroyed by cancer, offering a new lease on life to those with a diagnosis that once came with an inevitable death sentence. Stem cells have the power to slow the loss of a grandmother's memory, calm the hand of an uncle with Parkinson's, save a child from a lifetime of daily insulin shots, or permanently lift a best friend from his or her wheelchair.\nAt this very moment, some of the most pioneering cures and treatments are right at our fingertips, but because of the stem cell ban, they remain beyond our reach.\nThis is not the way we do things in America. Here in America, we don't sacrifice science for ideology. We are a land of discovery – a place where innovators and optimists are free to dream and explore. Where government encourages creativity and entrepreneurship instead of stifling it. Where we're always searching for the next breakthrough, always pushing the boundaries of our knowledge. And that's why we must lift the ban on stem cell research – and do so immediately. Every day that we wait, more than 3,000 Americans lose their lives to diseases that may someday be treatable because of stem cell research.\nWe must make funding for this research and other important scientific work a priority in our universities and our medical community. And we must secure more funding for it at agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.\nAbove all, we must look to the future not with fear, but with the hope and the faith that advances in science will advance our highest ideals.\nWe know that progress has always brought with it the worry that this time, we have gone too far. Believe it or not, there was a time when some questioned the morality of heart transplants. Not too long ago, we heard the same kind of arguments against the biotechnology research that now saves stroke victims and those with leukemia.\nPeople of good will and good sense can resolve the ethical issues without stopping life-saving research. America has long led the world in great discoveries, always upholding the highest standards, with our breakthroughs and our beliefs always going hand-in-hand. And when it comes to stem cell research, we will demand no less.\nSo to all of you who sit by the bedside of someone you love, losing hope about what the future holds. To those who lie awake at night, wondering whether you'll be around for a best friend's wedding, a daughter's graduation, a grandson's first steps. To those who pray each day for cures that are now beyond our reach – I want you to know that help is on the way.\nI want you to hold on, and keep faith, because come next January, when John Edwards and I are sworn into office, we're going to create a new anniversary – one that will be a cause for celebration. We're going to lift the ban on stem cell research. We're going to listen to our scientists and stand up for science. We're going to say yes to knowledge, yes to discovery, and yes to a new era of hope for all Americans.\nThanks for listening.", "timestamp": "2004-08-07", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29718", "text": "Over the last few weeks, John Edwards and I have made our way across this country we love, from sea to shining sea, because we believe in America and we believe we can do better.\nAnd at every stop we've made, from great cities to the great Southwest, from the flag-draped front porches of Main Street America to the small family farms that dot the Midwest, we've met Americans who believe that too.\nWhile millions are struggling to find work, and millions more are struggling to pay the bills, these folks hold on to an optimism that is both courageous and classically American. They know we can do better. They know our best days lie ahead. And they still believe in an America where a willingness to work hard is rewarded with the opportunity to earn a decent living and the chance to get ahead.\nJohn Edwards and I think it's time we built an economy that honors those values. And we think it's time the American people had a government that lives by them.\nWe believe a stronger America at home is built on a strong middle-class.\nThat's why today, after days of listening and learning about the hopes and concerns of hardworking people from every corner of America, and after more bad economic news for middle-class families, I'd like to talk about our real economic plan to build a stronger America.\nIt's a plan that makes us stronger by creating good-paying jobs here instead of shipping jobs overseas. A plan that makes us stronger by giving middle-class families tax breaks, not bigger bills. A plan that makes us stronger by revitalizing American manufacturing, helping our businesses become more competitive, and investing in the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow. And it's a plan that is our answer to the everyday Americans who have shared their dreams with us every moment of this journey. Theirs are the concerns we share. Theirs are the hopes we hold. And theirs are the stories that are the heart of our campaign to build a stronger America.\nThe road to this America takes us in a new and better direction. It's based on telling the American people the truth – not selling them shop-worn slogans. But, in the last week, we've been told over and over again that America has turned the corner.\nWhen we've had four years of disappearing manufacturing jobs that have put millions out of work, the Americans I've met don't think we've turned the corner.\nWhen we've had four years of falling wages, rising health care costs, and a shrinking middle-class, the Americans I've met don't think we've turned the corner.\nWhen we've had four years of people working harder and harder and still not getting ahead, the Americans I've met don't think we've turned the corner.\nToo many of the Americans I've met over the last few weeks not only don't think we've turned the corner – they feel like they've been backed into a corner by the policies of the last four years – rising unemployment...exploding deficits...falling wages....American jobs shipped overseas.\nThe sad fact is: Too many of our fellow citizens don't have to read about how disappointing last month's job numbers were, because they're living the disappointment. They don't need to be told about the rising costs of health care, because they're the ones who can't afford to take their child to the doctor. And they don't need to open the paper to find out that the new jobs being created pay $9,000 less than the ones we've lost, because they're the ones who open their paychecks and wonder how they'll pay the bills.\nThe response of this Administration – of those in charge -- is to tell us that this is the best economy we've ever had. And we're told anyone who thinks otherwise is a pessimist. Well, here is our answer: There is nothing more pessimistic than saying America can't do better.\nThere's a very simple reason we've gone four years without a plan to fix our economy: no one in the White House thought anything was broken. And they still don't. They're just fine with the same old failed policies of the past. That's why, like Herbert Hoover, they say prosperity is still just around the corner. And that's why we're still waiting to hear a plan for the next four years.\nWe can do better and we will. We're the optimists. For us, this is a country of the future. We're the can do people. And let's not forget what we did in the 1990s. We balanced the budget. We paid down the debt. We created 23 million new jobs. We lifted millions out of poverty and we lifted the standard of living for the middle class. We just need to believe in ourselves – and have the right leadership and the right policies -- and we can do it again.\nWe can make choices that widen the circle of opportunity for all Americans, not just the select few. We can build an economy with a growing middle-class where everyone has the chance to succeed. And we can finally create jobs and bring tax relief to all of our families.\nOver the last four years, again and again, we were promised that tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals would create millions of new jobs. Instead, we've lost jobs, and these unaffordable tax cuts have led America into deficits as far as the eye can see. This Administration is the first since Herbert Hoover's to actually lose jobs on its watch – 1.8 million jobs. Just last month, there were only 32,000 jobs created in the entire country – a pace far behind what is needed to keep up with the 2 million college graduates who will enter the workforce this spring.\nAnd now, to add insult to injury, just yesterday the other side talked about a national sales tax. At least that's what they call it. I call it one of the largest tax increases on the middle class in American history. This is from an Administration that has offered almost no new ideas for our economy – and the few they have proposed have only hurt middle class families. This one is no different. It's a twenty to thirty percent national sales tax -- on top of the state and local sales taxes that Americans already pay. This tax will hurt small business, it will hurt jobs, and it will hit the pocketbooks of those who need tax relief the most.\nMiddle-class families can't afford four more years of a tax plan that drives up unemployment, drives up the deficit, and drives up their tax burden and the costs of health care, child care, and college tuition. When tax cuts for the very wealthiest Americans are your first, second, and only priority, you don't have anything left to take care of health care premiums that have risen over $2,600. You don't have anything left to take care of skyrocketing property taxes in states struggling to pay for these deficits. And you don't have anything left to take care of the cost of child care and college tuition that has risen over $1,200.\nWhen tax cuts for the wealthiest are your only priority, you don't have anything left for middle-class Americans – and it's middle-class Americans who end up paying the largest share.\nI will be a president who stands with the middle class and stands for fairness\nWe believe it's time America had tax cuts that work for all Americans. We believe it's time we had tax cuts that help create good-paying jobs – right here in America. And, after four years of shifting the tax burden from those with the most to those most struggling to make ends meet, we believe it's time that America's tax code reflected America's moral code. And when I'm President, it will.\nI have a comprehensive economic plan for a stronger America that will allow us to create jobs and keep more good jobs here in America. It offers a long-term strategy to win our economic future, and it gives our workers the skills and the training they need to compete and succeed in a new economy. And, most importantly, it includes tax cuts that will create jobs and provide relief for middle-class families struggling to make ends meet – tax cuts that are paid for without increasing the deficit one single dime.\nFirst, we start with a Jobs First Tax Cut strategy that will replace deficit-expanding tax cuts for the few with job-creating tax cuts for every American.\nLet me tell you precisely what this Jobs First Tax Cut strategy includes. It starts by closing tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas. Instead of supporting an economic policy that thinks sending jobs overseas is good for America, we will provide tax incentives for companies that create and keep jobs where they belong – in the good ol' U.S.A.\nWe value an America that exports products, not jobs – and we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own job.\nTo the taxpaying businesses of America out there, our Jobs First Tax Cut strategy takes the savings from closing these loopholes to cut taxes for 99% of you. To the small businesses and manufacturers who decide to add more employees to the payroll, we will provide a New Jobs Tax Credit for every person you hire.\nWe will completely eliminate capital gains taxes for those who make long-term investments in the small businesses and entrepreneurs who have always been America's engine for innovation and job creation. And to those small business owners who want to hire more employees but cannot afford to insure them, we will give you up to a 50% tax cut on your health care contributions when you cover your workers.\nMy plan focuses on the rising cost of health care for families and small businesses, because I know that no working parent ever feels they are turning the corner unless they have a job that not only provides a decent wage, but the heath care that every family needs and deserves.\nWe need a president who understands that the health of our economy is tied to the health of our citizens.\nFinally, my tax plan will make our tax code fair. You know, our tax code has gone from 14 pages to 17,000 pages. It's time to crack down on tax shelters, taking Enron's page out of the tax code so we can add another page for working families.\nSecond, our middle-class tax cuts will raise middle-class incomes.\nWe're tired of people just getting by; we want people to get ahead. So to help you pay for health care, we'll offer a tax break and health care reform to lower your premiums up to $1,000. To help you cover the rising costs of child care, we'll offer a tax credit up to $1,000 to cover those costs so your kids have a safe place to go while you work. And to give your child the chance to go to college, we'll offer a tax break on up to $4,000 in tuition.\nTo pay for all this, we make sure that 98 percent of all Americans keep their tax cuts, while rolling back only the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year so that we can invest in health care, education, and job-creation. They will go back to paying the same taxes they paid when Bill Clinton was president – a time when the rich got richer, and so did everyone else.\nAnd to help folks in states where these unaffordable tax cuts for the wealthy have driven up deficits and killed jobs, we will offer $25 billion in relief to lower tuition costs, keep property taxes down, and make sure we can afford to defend our homeland.\nThird, we believe it's time for Washington to lives within a budget just like you do. We will make sure that these tax cuts don't add one dime to the deficit so that we can protect Social Security and so that our children aren't paying for them for the rest of their lives. Four years ago, this Administration was handed a record surplus. Today, we have record deficits. Passing or proposing $6 trillion in spending over the last four years without paying for a dime of it has jeopardized job creation and the foundation of economic strength in America.\nOur plan will cut the deficit in half in four years by ending tax giveaways that are nothing more than corporate welfare – and we will make government go back to a simple rule: pay as you go. And we will cut the waste from our government – cutting 100,000 contractors we don't need, cutting the top-level bureaucracy that has grown over the last four years, cutting government agencies that have outlived their purposes.\nFinally, our economic plan is not just about economic relief today, it's also about making the long-term investments in our nation's future. If we want America to thrive in the long run, we must invest more in our people and their ideas, in science and technology, so that we can create high-tech, high-wage jobs in industries that are already improving the quality of our lives. We will offer tax credits to help us seize the possibilities of the Broadband Revolution and make Internet access available to all of America's families. We will offer tax credits to buy and produce the fuel-efficient cars of the future, so that we can finally build an Energy Independent America. And we will give our workers the education and the job training that the jobs of tomorrow require today.\nOur economic plan for America is based on the values we hold as Americans: that we should reward work, make sure Americans have a chance to work, and give them a chance to get ahead when they do.\nWe value jobs that pay you more not less than you earned before. We value jobs where, when you put in a week's work, you can actually pay your bills, provide for your children, and lift up the quality of your life. We value an America where the middle class is not being squeezed, but doing better.\nThese aren't Democratic values. These aren't Republican values. They're American values. We believe in them. They're who we are. And if we honor them, if we believe in ourselves, we can build an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.\nYou know, the last time a campaign took a cross-country trip across America was when Harry Truman ran for President in 1948. Their whistle-stop tour steamed through many of the small towns ours has, and when it reached the coasts of California, the man from Missouri who had spent a lifetime given ‘em hell told the crowd, \"I wish I were 18 instead of 64. I would like to see the next 50 years because I think the greatest age in the history of the world is in front of us, and that age depends entirely on the proper leadership in the United States of America.\"\nMy friends, we can do more than turn corners. We can take a new path that will lead America to a better place and greater times.\nWe can do more than turn corners. We can turn our economy around, and build one that works for every American.\nJohn Edwards and I are ready to lead, and we have a plan to get us there – a plan to build a better America. Like Franklin Roosevelt, my test is not whether an idea is Democrat or Republican, but whether it will work. My tax plan to create jobs for the middle class will work. And it's going to put our economy back on track.\nWe can do this. We can reach for the next dream. We can look to the next horizon. For America, the hope is there. The sun is rising. Our best days are still to come. Thank you and God bless you.", "timestamp": "2004-08-12", "title": "Remarks in Carson, California"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29719", "text": "Thank you. I am proud to be a lifetime member of this organization and grateful for your continued deep commitment to veterans and to the defense and security of our nation. For more than 100 years now, you have had many distinguished veterans come before you – some Republican, some Democrat, some presidents. But as a fellow veteran, I can proudly say that there is one title that is more important than all, and that is patriot. You have all earned that title and I am proud to stand with you today.\nA few weeks ago, at the Democratic National Convention, I told the American people that I was reporting for duty. I did not say that lightly. I said it paying homage to and drawing strength from my crewmates on stage, the more than 500 delegates who were veterans in the Fleet Center and especially all of you -- every man and woman who has ever worn the uniform of the United States armed forces. We understand that the duty to serve goes on throughout our lives. That is what really brings us here today: our continued resolve to defend America so that all can share in the blessings of freedom. And let there be no doubt – when I am president, you will have a true brother in arms in the White House who understands that those who fought for their country abroad should never have to fight for what they were promised at home.\nIn the spirit of all the men and women in uniform who we honor here, let me offer this pledge: As president, I will always remember that America's security begins and ends with the soldier, sailor, airman, Marine and Coastguardsman – with every man and every woman in our armed services who has ever stood guard at the gates of freedom. Today, I salute each and every one of you for your commitment, strength and extraordinary courage. America says thank you – and we all join in a special salute to Greatest Generation vets whose memorial finally stands proudly in a place of honor on the Mall in Washington. Thank you for your extraordinary example as citizen soldiers.\nI also want to speak directly for a moment to those currently risking their lives as faraway as Iraq and Afghanistan. America's prayers are with you. We honor your service, thank you for your sacrifice and pledge to stand with your families as you stand for ours.\nLike veterans of all wars past, today's fighting men and women, deserve our prayers and support and then, when they come home, they deserve the respect and welcome of a grateful nation. After all, the first definition of patriotism is to keep faith with those who have worn the uniform of the United States of America.\nOne of the best ways to do that is to make sure that those who have served us on the frontlines return to an America that gives them the tools to build strong families and strong communities here at home. This means transitional assistance to help all those returning from war, struggling to readjust to civilian life, and coping with the scars of battle, those both seen and unseen. This is about keeping a sacred promise. It is about love of country. And it is about protecting those who have risked their lives to protect ours.\nIn recent days, you have heard from some who have claimed that the job is getting done for veterans. Well, just saying the job is getting done doesn't make it so. My friends, let me tell you when the job will be done. The job will be done when 500,000 veterans are not excluded from the VA healthcare system. The job will be done when we're not closing VA hospitals, so that veterans can't reach the care they need. The job will be done when veterans are not asked for increasing co-payments, enrollment fees, and other charges to shift the burden of care to other veterans and drive more than a million veterans out of the system.\nThe job will be done when 400,000 military retirees get real concurrent receipt. The job will be done when there are no homeless veterans on the streets of America. The job will be done when more than 320,000 veterans no longer are waiting for decisions on disability claims and another 100,000 are not awaiting appeals decisions. The job will be done when the VA Secretary does not have to complain that he needs more than the White House wanted to give him. And the job will be done when the family of 21-year-old Jay Briseno, a veteran facing a lifetime of disability, doesn't have to sleep at his bedside because the VA can't afford to give him the round-the-clock nursing care he needs. It is clear: when it comes to protecting America's 26 million veterans and their families we are far from being able to claim, \"mission accomplished.\"\nAs President, I will stand with you to complete that mission. The sacrifices that you have made on the battlefield are well known. But what is not as well known is how hard we have fought after we returned from service to keep faith with our fellow soldiers. How we fought to get additional funds for VA hospitals that couldn't provide adequate care. How we put together the first outreach groups to help deal with post traumatic stress disorder. How we pushed to get the GI Bill extended so that no vet lost their chance for a better future. And how we won increases for veteran's allowances and living expenses.\nWe kept faith. Together, with the help from the leadership of the VFW we can be proud that we put in place the most thorough, the most exhaustive, the most extensive effort to account for missing, captured or dead in all the history of human warfare. We made that happen – we veterans and we should all be proud of keeping faith. I am especially proud that together with Bob Smith and John McCain we led and won this fight.\nWhen I got involved in this issue, there were hundreds of individuals whose fates were unknown. Today that number has been reduced to 35. That means that families now have the peace of mind and the comfort of knowing that their loved ones are resting in peace. I went back to Vietnam to search for our POWs and missing because I believe, as you do, that a soldier never leaves anyone behind.\nThat is why I fought for the legislation that allowed veterans to be treated in VA hospitals for devastating Agent Orange conditions like cancer and neurological disorders. Again, we kept faith.\nI will continue to stand with you as president, leading the fight for a Military Family Bill of Rights and leading the fight for full, mandatory funding for Veterans health care.\nMilitary families are going through difficult times these days. Many of their loved ones are in faraway places, leaving them to care for their families alone. The last thing our servicemen and women need on their minds is the stress of wondering if their loved ones back home will be okay. What they need is a president who protects their families while they are putting their lives on the line protecting the American family. That means making sure families have competitive pay, good housing, decent health care and quality education for their children.\nKeeping faith with our veterans also means making sure they get full concurrent receipt. Today, we have only partially met this obligation. I'm not going to come to the VFW to tell you the job is done when it is not done. If you earned a pension – it's yours – just like in the private sector. If you get a disability payment, it is because you have suffered. I don't believe you subtract what you suffered from what you earned. As president, I won't stop fighting until our veterans get the full disability payments they deserve.\nYou and I who once left our families and our shores to defend the principles that make America great, understand more than most the cost of keeping our country free. When you hear that more than 940 American troops have been lost on the battlefield of Iraq and that more than 6,200 of our troops have been wounded, some disabled for a lifetime ... these are more than numbers to you and me. These are our brothers and sisters ... our sons and daughters ... America's heroes.\nThey testify to the truth that we will never back down in defense of freedom. We will use superior military force to overcome any enemy. Let me be clear: like you, I defended this country as a young man. And I will defend it as president. I will never hesitate to use force when it is required. Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response. Any imminent threat to our security will be dealt with swiftly and severely. I will never give any nation or international institution a veto over our national security. And I will build a stronger American military.\nBut, in these dangerous times, there is a right way and a wrong way to be strong. Strength is more than tough words.\nAfter September 11th, I am proud that all our people rallied to the President's call for unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats, there were no Republicans there were only Americans.\nHow we wish it had stayed that way.\nBut since then, we have become a country divided over Iraq – and it didn't have to be that way.\nAs veterans, we know what kids go through when they are carrying an M-16 in a dangerous place and they can't tell friend from foe. We know what they go through when they're out on patrol at night and they don't know what's coming around the next bend. We know what it's like to write letters home telling your family that everything's all right when you're not sure that's true.\nI know what we have to do in Iraq. We need a President who has the credibility to bring our allies to our side because that's the right way to get the job done in Iraq and bring our troops home.\nWe need to bring in NATO and other nations to share the cost and burdens. Right now, the United States is shouldering the lions share of this effort. Ninety percent of all coalition forces and nearly ninety percent of coalition coffins are draped with American flags. The American taxpayers are also paying the vast share of the cost of this war.\nWe also need to massively improve and accelerate our training of Iraqi police and security forces so they can defend their own country; and we need ensure that there is far greater security to provide the credible elections in 2005 critical to advance Iraq's transition to stable, representative democracy.\nAs President, I will always ask hard questions and I will demand hard evidence. I will immediately reform the intelligence system – so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics.\nAs president, I will wage war with the lessons I learned in war. Before you go to battle, you have to be able to look a parent or family member in the eye and truthfully say: We tried everything possible to avoid sending your son or daughter into harm's way. But we had no choice.\nAnd now, with so much at stake in the struggle against Al Qaeda the American people want to hear, in plain words the answer to a simple question. How are we going to get the terrorists before they get us? Just what is our strategy – not just for striking back against the terrorists, but for defeating their aims, destroying their movement, discrediting their cause, and bringing old and new friends to our side? What is our long-term strategy for making America safer?\nOver the course of this campaign, I have laid out my plans to reshape and rebuild the American military so that it is ready to fight tomorrow's wars, not yesterday's. As a combat veteran who has walked in your shoes, I know that the first duty of a commander in chief is to make sure that our troops are the best trained, best equipped fighting force in the world. And to never send them into battle without a plan to win the peace.\nThat is why I have called for adding 40,000 new troops, not in Iraq, but to relieve the pressure on our overstretched forces. The fact is, the war in Iraq has taken a real toll on our armed services. Ninety percent of the Army's active duty combat divisions are either in Iraq, have been to Iraq, or are on their way.\nI will also double our Army Special Forces so we can find and get the terrorists before they get us.\nAnd we must end the stop-loss and involuntary recall of troops that amounts to nothing more than a back-door draft. To fight this war, we have called up our Guard and Reserves at historic levels. And many of these units are being pushed to the limit. The Administration has extended tours of duty, delayed retirements, and prevented enlisted personnel from leaving the service. And when these troops come home, many have lost the job they left. We're going to see to it that everyone who fought for this country has a good job when they come back to this country.\nAt the same time, we must strengthen our homeland security and do everything we can to prevent another 9/11. We shouldn't be letting ninety-five percent of container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected. We shouldn't be leaving our nuclear and chemical plants without enough protection. And we must make sure first responders have the training and equipment they need.\nBut, as you know, winning the war on terror demands a team effort. We all know that the best intelligence comes from working cooperatively with other nations – through real intelligence sharing and joint operations. That's why for months now, I have been calling for the creation of a National Director of Intelligence with the authority to oversee all of our intelligence agencies.\nLast month, the 9/11 Commission embraced many of these ideas. I have urged the President and the Congress to act – and act now – to implement them. But if we are going to win this war, we will have to listen to another profoundly important recommendation made by the Commission. \"Long term success demands the use of all elements of national power: diplomacy, intelligence, covert action, law enforcement, economic policy, foreign aid, public diplomacy and homeland defense.\"\nAs President, I will fight a smarter, more effective war on terror. We will deploy every tool in our arsenal: our economic as well as our military might; our principles as well as our firepower. Only then will be able to tell the terrorists: You will lose and we will win.\nFinally, I want to say something about the plan that the President announced on Monday to withdraw 70,000 troops from Asia and Europe. Nobody wants to bring troops home more than those of us who have fought in foreign wars. But it needs to be done at the right time and in a sensible way. This is not that time or that way.\nLet's be clear: the President's vaguely stated plan does not strengthen our hand in the war against terror. And in no way relieves the strain on our overextended military personnel. And this hastily announced plan raises more doubts about our intentions and our commitments than it provides real answers.\nFor example, why are we unilaterally withdrawing 12,000 troops from the Korean Peninsula at the very time we are negotiating with North Korea – a country thatreally has nuclear weapons? As Senator John McCain said, \"I'm particularly concerned about moving troops out of South Korea when North Korea has probably never been more dangerous than any time since the end of the Korean War.\" This is clearly the wrong signal to send at the wrong time.\nWith al Qaeda operating in 60 countries, we need closer alliances in every part of the world to fight and win the war on terrorism. So, as president, I will be a commander in chief who renews our alliances based on shared interests and a common vision for a safer world. For more than 50 years, our allies have joined with us to say: the future doesn't belong to fear; it belongs to freedom.\nAs veterans, we know we can win the war on terror. As men and women who have worn the uniform of our country, you know better than most that we can make our nation stronger at home and respected in the world.\nAnd so, whether the issue is standing by our vets and their families or standing up for our principles, our values and our freedom, the big question before us is not just who will lead America. It is whether America will continue to lead in the world.\nI am running for President because I believe that if we honor our highest values and do right by our men and women in uniform, America will continue to be a beacon of hope and freedom for all the world.\nThank you for your service to our country and God bless you and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2004-08-18", "title": "Remarks to the Veterans of Foreign Wars 105th Annual Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29720", "text": "Talk about a warm welcome! It's great to see my good friend, Harold Schaitberger. As you know, Harold and I spent a lot of time together in Iowa and New Hampshire. He's a terrific campaigner, and an outstanding leader. And I want to congratulate him and Vinnie – I can only hope that our re-election in 2008 goes as well as theirs did yesterday.\nI'd also like to take a moment to honor a young man whose courage, compassion, and love for life were an inspiration to us all. Mattie Stepanek was a poet, a philosopher, and a peacemaker – and he was also your number one fan. As hard as it is to lose him, he will never be forgotten.\nI'd also like to remember the brothers of Local 1009. It's hard to believe it's been five years since that warehouse in Worcester went up in flames. Six brave men went in. None of them came out alive. And as I stood with those families, I looked them in the eyes, and promised that their brothers, fathers, sons and husbands would never be forgotten. And I know they haven't been.\nAnd neither have those who gave their lives on September 11th, the day that so many of America's finest rushed into burning towers so that others could rush out. They didn't ask questions. They didn't look back. And three hundred and forty-three of them made the ultimate sacrifice. Their courage lifted our nation.\nFinally, I want to pay tribute to your brothers and sisters who, at this very moment, are on the frontlines in Iraq and Afghanistan. May God protect them and bring them home safely to their families and our country.\nNow, as you all know, it's been a pretty exciting couple of months for our campaign. Back in early July, I was talking with an old friend of mine, and he asked me what I'd been up to. I told him, \"Well, I've been gearing up for that big event in Boston, working on my big speech, practicing every day.\" And he said, \"Yup, I'll bet you have.\" And I said, \"This is one of the most important speeches of my career.\" And he said, \"It sure is.\" And I said, \"I really want to hit this one out of the park.\" And he said, \"John, don't you worry, I'm sure you'll do just fine at the Democratic Convention.\"\nAnd I said, \"Democratic Convention? Who's talking about the Democratic convention? I was talking about the IAFF Convention!\"\nIn all seriousness, I'm so proud to be here with all of you today. Every day, you keep our families and communities safe. Every day you risk your lives to protect ours. Every day you give so much to this country we love. Today, I want to talk about how we can give back – about how we can give you the support you need, and the respect you deserve.\nIt's been a long journey to this moment. Since I entered this race a year and a half ago, I've traveled from one end of this country to the other – from great cities to the great Southwest, from the flag-draped front porches of Main Street America to the small family farms that dot the Midwest. I'm proud that we've made this great journey together.\nAll of you here today stood with me right from the beginning – and you never left my side. In those long days in Iowa, you were there. In those cold days in New Hampshire, you were there. When the polls were down, and they counted us out, you never gave up hope. And today, wherever I go, I look up, and the first thing I see are those gold and black T-shirts, and those gold and black signs – and I know that once again, my friends are by my side.\nThrough these long months, you have shown what we always knew was true: Firefighters never give up. Firefighters never leave a brother or sister behind. And no matter how tough it gets, firefighters can take the heat.\nThese are the values you live by, day in and day out, when you kiss your families goodbye, and head to the station – knowing full well that with the sound of an alarm, you might be called into harms way. I know what that's like. And more than thirty years ago, I learned an important lesson – when you're under attack, the best thing to do is turn your boat into the attacker. That's what I intend to do today.\nOver the last week or so, a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth has been attacking me. Of course, this group isn't interested in the truth – and they're not telling the truth. They didn't even exist until I won the nomination for president.\nBut here's what you really need to know about them. They're funded by hundreds of thousands of dollars from a Republican contributor out of Texas. They're a front for the Bush campaign. And the fact that the President won't denounce what they're up to tells you everything you need to know – he wants them to do his dirty work.\nThirty years ago, official Navy reports documented my service in Vietnam and awarded me the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts. Thirty years ago, this was the plain truth. It still is. And I still carry the shrapnel in my leg from a wound in Vietnam.\nAs firefighters you risk your lives everyday. You know what it's like to see the truth in the moment. You're proud of what you've done – and so am I.\nOf course, the President keeps telling people he would never question my service to our country. Instead, he watches as a Republican-funded attack group does just that. Well, if he wants to have a debate about our service in Vietnam, here is my answer: \"Bring it on.\"\nI'm not going to let anyone question my commitment to defending America – then, now, or ever. And I'm not going to let anyone attack the sacrifice and courage of the men who saw battle with me.\nAnd let me make this commitment today: their lies about my record will not stop me from fighting for jobs, health care, and our security – the issues that really matter to the American people.\nThe situation in Iraq is a mess. That is the President's responsibility and he owes the American people an answer.\nAmerica is on track to lose more jobs than it's gained under George Bush and he supports a tax code that rewards companies for shipping jobs overseas. He owes the American people an answer.\nHealth care costs have exploded out of control. The President has done nothing and he owes the American people an answer.\nThe middle class is paying a bigger share of America's tax burden. The President needs to answer to the American people why that is fair.\nUnfortunately, those in the White House are coming from a different place than you and I. They see things a little differently than you and I. They tell us that today, when it comes to the issues that matter most, we're getting the job done.\nWell, just saying the job is getting done doesn't make it so. My friends, let me tell you when the job will be done.\nThe job will be done when every firehouse in America has the firefighters and the equipment they need to protect our communities. Right now, two-thirds of firehouses are understaffed, and we're not spending one dime to fund the SAFER Act.\nThe job will be done when all our firefighters have the resources to fight the war on terror here at home. Right now, in too many places, your budgets are being cut to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans.\nAnd, my friends, the job will be done when we stop opening firehouses in Baghdad while closing them down here in the United States of America.\nFor four years, we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values are not just words. They're what we live by. They're about the choices we make, the causes we champion, and the people we fight for.\nLet me tell you about my values. The way I see it, all of you are full-time heroes, and you deserve nothing less than America's full-time support.\nThat's why, for nineteen years in the Senate, I've fought for better equipment and training, for tracking technology and workplace protections. I sponsored the Federal Presumptive Disability legislation, because when federal firefighters get sick because of their job, they deserve our help. And I've fought for collective bargaining for all employees – including federal employees – and I'll take on anyone who tries to take it away.\nAnd that's just the beginning. When John Edwards and I are in the White House, we're going to fund the FIRE Act and the SAFER Act. We're going to create the Father Mychal Judge fund to hire 100,000 new firefighters all across America. And we're going to be an Administration that stands with labor. Let us never forget that every single one of the firefighters who went up the stairs of those burning towers, and through the doors of that warehouse in Worcester – all of them were members of organized labor. They believed in the right to organize...the right to overtime pay...the right to have a Secretary of Labor who comes from labor. And we do too. Those are our values, and we're going to live and lead by them every day that we're in the White House. And that's how we're going to get the job done.\nFinally, we're going to really get the job done by creating an economy that works for you and your families, where when you work hard, you can pay your bills and create a better life for your children.\nRight now, middle class Americans are being squeezed like never before. In the last three years, we've lost 1.8 million private sector jobs. And the new jobs being created pay $9,000 less than the ones we've lost. At the same time, gas prices are up, childcare costs are up, tuition is up, and family income has fallen $1,500. As a result, today, we've got people working two jobs, three jobs, just to get by. That's not the American way.\nTo make matters worse, health care costs are through the roof. The average American family has seen their premiums increase by more than $2,600 in just the last three years. And I know that some of you have seen the results at the bargaining table, where you win an increase in wages only to see it disappear to pay for health care.\nThis is bad news for our families and even worse news for our economy. Studies show that rising costs have forced many employers – especially those in industries that pay high wages – to slow their hiring. And many have begun hiring more part-time and temporary workers, who often don't get health insurance at all. So we're losing good jobs and replacing them with ones that just don't pay the bills.\nWhen I'm President, America will stop being the only advanced country that doesn't understand that health care is not a privilege for the elected or the connected or the wealthy – but a right for all Americans. John Edwards and I have a plan to reduce health care costs and turn our economy around. We're going to provide tax credits to make health insurance more affordable. And we're going to let all Americans buy into the same plan available to members of Congress. In total, we'll cut the average family's premium by $1,000.\nThe issues I've been talking about today – these aren't Republican issues or Democratic issues. They're American values. And frankly, it doesn't make one bit of difference to me what party you belong to or who you've voted for in the past. That's not what this election is about.\nThis election is about building an America that's stronger at home and respected around the world. Where families sleep soundly at night knowing you have what you need to do your jobs. An America where we once again honor those who serve our communities and protect our families.\nThere's a simple rule you follow in every fire you fight: You never go in alone – you always have a brother or sister by your side. Well, today, I want you to know that come next January, you will have a brother in the White House who stands with you every hour of every day. I will be a president who goes into the Oval Office every morning knowing that my job is to help you do yours. I will work my heart out for you, and I will never let you down.\nBut once again, I can't get there without your help. In the closing weeks of this campaign, I'm going to be traveling all across this country, talking to Americans about our values and our vision for the future. And I need you to do the same. I need you to go back to your states and knock on every door, make every call, and register every voter you can. Tell people about who we are, what we stand for, and what we're going to do for America. And on election day, you make sure that every single person you've reached goes to the polls and makes their voice heard. In a race like this, we can't afford to lose a single vote.\nThis isn't going to be easy, but firefighters are no strangers to tough challenges. I know that working together, we can take back America for its heroes. We can reach for the next dream. We can look to the next horizon. For America, the hope is there. The sun is rising. Our best days are still to come. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2004-08-19", "title": "Remarks to the International Association of Fire Fighters in Boston"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29721", "text": "Thank you for that generous introduction. It is an honor to be here at an institution where America's learning has been so consistently advanced – and America's history so often made. For nearly a century and a half, Cooper Union has produced some of our nation's leading architects, engineers and artists. You have also helped lay the foundation and design the blueprint of our democracy. Great American values have always had a home here.\nSeeing Cooper Union as a sanctuary and a force for equality, the NAACP was organized here. Seeing it as a symbol and a center of concern for others, the Red Cross was organized here. It is no accident that Thomas Edison, the man who invented the light bulb, and much of the rest of modern life, was a student here. And I can't help but noting that at least five presidents – Grant, Cleveland, Taft, Teddy Roosevelt, and, of course, Lincoln spoke here as candidates. So I've been kind of looking forward to this speech.\nBut to me, this contest this year is not just about winning a campaign. It is about making America stronger at home and respected in the world. It is about reclaiming the character of our country and the integrity of our politics.\nI am here today to call for a truthful and robust debate about our values as Americans and the fundamental choices we will make at a critical time in our history. That is what this election should be about. But from the other side, we have seen a calculated effort to evade that debate. The Bush campaign and its allies have turned to the tactics of fear and smear because they can't talk about jobs, health care, energy independence, and rebuilding our alliances – the real issues that matter to the American people. They have no plans, no positive vision and no understanding of an urgent and undeniable truth -- a stronger America begins at home.\nNext week, the Republicans will hold their convention here in New York. You should be proud of all you have done to prepare for and to protect this event. In the post 9/11 world, New Yorkers, more than most Americans, understand the importance of doing everything we can to make our country safer and more secure. Your city and your first responders have led in that effort and I applaud you for it.\nThe world will listen to what the Republicans say when they come here. But words, slogans, and personal attacks cannot disguise what they have done – and left undone. They are going to say that we've turned the corner; that the job is getting done. They are even going to claim, as they already have, that this is the best economy of our lifetimes. They have obviously decided that some people will believe anything, no matter how fictional or how far-fetched, if they just repeat it often enough. That's how they have run their administration; that's how they're running their campaign and that's how they will run their convention. I believe the American people are smarter than that. You can't cover up reality with a few empty slogans. You can't lead America by misleading the American people.\nI don't believe that four years of lost jobs, lower wages, higher health care costs, higher tuitions and tax cuts for the few are the best we can do. America can do better. And we will.\nWhile our opponents have focused on false reassurance and false attacks, John Edwards and I have traveled across this country, listening and responding to the hopes and concerns of the American people. On front porches, in town squares, in open fields and great cities like this, families have gathered to tell us what matters most to them.\nThey tell us to make sure that their sons and daughters in uniform risking their lives half a world away come home to a country where they can have a chance to live out their dreams – to find a good paying job, the chance to start their own business, a home they can pay for, affordable health care, the chance to send their kids to college.\nThe American people have also told us that they want a country that lives up to its ideals of responsibility, community, and opportunity for all. In the end, their concerns, like this election, are really about values. For four years, we've heard a lot of talk in Washington about values. But values are not just words. They're what we live by. They're the choices we make. Our values are how we define the difference between right and wrong. And ultimately, this election is not just a choice between Democrats and Republicans, but between what is right for America and policies that are wrong for the American people.\nThe fundamental choice we face comes down to this: Because a strong America begins at home, as President, I will be a champion for the middle class and those struggling to join it.\nBut this administration has weakened our middle class, weakened our economy, neglected the crisis of health care and turned away from the American dream of growth and opportunity for all.\nEvery step of the way, George W. Bush has put the narrow interests of the few ahead of the interests of most Americans.\nThe middle class has always been the moral and economic backbone of this nation. That's why Franklin Roosevelt signed the G.I. Bill to help people go to college, buy a house, and build their wealth. Under Bill Clinton, we created 23 million new jobs, lifted 7 million Americans out of poverty, and sent millions more Americans to college. The middle class built this nation. They work hard, pay their bills, and do right by their families. Our country ought to do right by them.\nToday, there is no more powerful example of the fundamental choice we face in this election than the issue of the economy.\nThe Bush administration blamed a weak economy on events out of their control.\nThen they made a big promise of six million new jobs by the middle of 2004. They, in fact, have lost 1.8 million jobs. So now they offer another strategy: denial and attack. And as we will hear at their convention – the pretense that they finally have a plan for jobs.\nBut this is the reality: No jobs. No record they're willing to run on. And no real plans for the future.\nAnd you can't make up for four years in a few days of a convention and a few weeks of campaigning.\nThey say our economy has turned a corner. That's not what John Edwards and I are hearing from people from one end of this country to the other.\nAmerica can do better. And the fundamental choice voters face is this: do we accept an economy that benefits the special interests or do we want an economy that works for the middle class?\nIt is a choice between an administration that says it's right to reward companies for shipping American jobs overseas – and a new leadership that will close those tax loopholes and provide incentives to create the good paying jobs of the future here in the United States of America.\nIt is a choice between the first Administration since Herbert Hoover to preside over a net loss of jobs – or new leadership with a plan to create jobs that pay people more, not $9,000 less than they earned before. Jobs where after a week's work, people can actually pay their bills, provide for their children, and lift up the quality of their lives.\nThe choice in this election is between an administration that has turned the largest surpluses in American history into the largest deficits and new leadership with a real plan to cut the deficit in half in the next four years. We will do it by passing the reforms John McCain and I have fought for to end corporate welfare – and by making government live by the same rules our families have to follow: pay as you go.\nAnd both fairness and fiscal responsibility depend on another fundamental choice -- between tax cuts for the few and tax cuts for the middle class. Should we continue a failed fiscal policy that says to middle class families: Tax cuts for Halliburton and Enron and those who make more than $200,000 a year are more important than tax cuts for you?\nAs President, I will put the middle class first. John Edwards and I have a plan to cut taxes for the middle class and working families – to help them pay for health care, child care, and sending a son or daughter to college.\nWhen we talk about the economy, we talk about jobs. But there is another side to the economy where there is a fundamental choice – and that is health care. When health care is more expensive...when co-pays and deductibles go through the roof...businesses, especially small businesses, are burdened by staggering health care costs. And that makes it harder to hire workers, harder to grow and harder to expand.\nIn the last four years, four million people have lost their health insurance. 44 million Americans are now without any health coverage at all. And middle class families are struggling to afford health costs that are going through the roof. Today, we have an administration that puts the interests of HMOs and big drug companies over the interests of patients and seniors and health care providers.\nIn a Kerry-Edwards Administration, we will see to it that that America is no longer the only industrialized nation in the world that doesn't understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected and the elected – it is a right for every single American.\nWe have a plan to get the greed and waste out of the system – and save the average family up to $1,000 a year in their premiums. At the same time, we will make health care affordable and accessible for all. Under our plan, you will get to pick your own doctors – and doctors and patients, not insurance company bureaucrats, will make medical decisions. You will be able to buy less expensive medicines from countries like Canada. And instead of this Administration's multi-billion dollar windfall for the big drug companies, we will pass a real prescription drug benefit for all seniors.\nThis election is also a choice between a country where men and women who work and save all their lives suddenly find their pensions disappearing into thin air and the executives who looted them bailing out on golden parachutes. Or leadership that says everybody in America – from the White House to the boardroom to Main Street – has a responsibility to play by the rules, obey the law and treat people with dignity.\nOn almost every issue before us, we face the same fundamental choice – between the narrow interests of the few and the future of the vast majority of Americans. It is a choice between an anti-science policy that gives in to right-wing pressures – or new leadership that believes in science and the stem cell research that can treat and cure disease and save millions of lives. It is a choice between holding secret meetings with polluters in the White House to rewrite our environmental laws – or protecting the air our children breathe and the water they drink.\nIt is a choice between siding with big oil and making America independent of Mideast oil. When we only have 3 percent of the world's oil reserves and we depend on foreign nations for 61 percent of what we consume, we can't drill our way out of an energy crisis. We have to invent our way out of it.\nJohn Edwards and I have a plan to invest in new technologies, alternative fuels, and the vehicles of the future so we can achieve energy independence of Middle East oil in ten years. This is our choice: We want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation, not the Saudi Royal family.\nI have spoken often in this campaign about national security – about rebuilding and leading strong alliances to find and get the terrorists before they get us. I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as President. But I also know that we can't be strong abroad unless we're strong at home.\nAnd that depends not only on new policies – as important as they are – but on the most basic choice we will make this year about what kind of country we are. We have to decide between a leadership that seeks to divide us and a leadership that brings people together. It is a choice between a White House that only talks with those it agrees with...that sees us only as red states and blue states and a leadership that honors the rich diversity of all of our people and sees us as One America – red, white and blue.\nWhen Abraham Lincoln was here at Cooper Union in 1860 to decry the continued spread of slavery, he spoke in tones of strength and humility. He said then: \"Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.\"\nMy duty, as I understand it, is to be a President who stands with middle class families in their hopes and their struggles...a President who has a plan to strengthen our economy...a President who knows a stronger America begins at home.\nMy duty, as I understand it, is to be a President and commander-in-chief who finds the truth and tells the truth instead of misleading the American people, hiding behind front groups, saying anything and doing anything to avoid the real issues that matter like jobs, health care and the war in Iraq.\nMy duty, as I understand it, is to fight for opportunity for all, and special privileges for none – so that every child, every parent, and every worker in America has an equal shot at living up to their God-given potential. A president who puts the middle class first puts their values first: hard work, respect for the truth and a commitment to what is right for Americans.\nThat is the kind of President I intend to be. And that is what I have fought for all my public life. As a prosecutor, I fought for victim's rights. As a Senator, I was a leader in the fight to put 100,000 new police on our streets. I broke with many in my own party to support a balanced budget. I stood with John McCain to find out the truth about what happened to our POWs and MIAs in Vietnam.\nAnd I've always stood up for our veterans who stood on the frontlines for us. I am proud that I wrote the legislation that finally provided help and health care to the victims of Agent Orange.\nI am also proud of the role I played in the landmark law that provides health care to the children of working families.\nSo, if people want to know the real choice in this election, just look at the record. For more than 20 years, I've fought for the middle class and those struggling to join it. But time after time, President Bush has sided with the narrow interests of the few.\nNext week at Madison Square Garden, the Republican convention will focus on slogans, excuses, and attack politics. And mark my words, they'll bend over backwards with last minute proposals and last minute promises to make up for all they haven't done and to pretend they're not who they are. In fact, pretending to be something they're not may be the single most consistent thing about them, because that's what they've been doing all along.\nBut the American people want truthful answers and real plans. They want leadership that will really put the middle class first. And that's why this is the most important election of our lifetime.\nAmerica must do better and we will.\nMy fellow citizens, we're the optimists. We're the can do people. For us, this is a country of the future. And we believe that for America to be truly America, it must be a country of opportunity for all Americans.\nSo, it's time for an honest debate about the choices we face. It's time to reach for the next dream and look to the next horizon. For America, the hope is there. The sun is rising. Our best days are still to come.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-08-24", "title": "Remarks at the Cooper Union in New York City"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29722", "text": "Hello West Virginia! It's great to be here in Racine - where coal was born and where four-wheeling was perfected. Thank you for what you do; your work is important to our important to our country. Today, America celebrates Labor Day, and we celebrate what you do, just like we've done for more than a hundred years. As Harry Truman once said, \"Whenever labor does well ... the whole country does well.\" And we're here today to talk about how our country's doing.\nOver the last few years, I've thought a lot about why America is heading in the wrong direction. Lost jobs, health care costs through the roof, the surplus gone, our alliances shredded, and our influence challenged. And then the other day, we were driving along the road in our campaign bus, and I saw a sign with a lone \"W\" leaning up against a post. At first, I was a little confused. But then, it all made sense.\nAs the president likes to say, there's nothing complicated about it. It does all come down to one letter -- W. George W. Bush. What do you think that W stands for? That W stands for wrong. Wrong choices, wrong direction for America. And this election all comes down to one decision: Do we want four more years of wrong choices, or do we want to move America in a new direction?\nThe choice in this election couldn't be more clear. Do we want four more years of lost jobs and falling wages ... four more years of rising health care costs ... four more years of raiding Social Security to give tax cuts to the wealthy ... four more years of schools being shortchanged, leaving millions of children behind ... four more years of shipping jobs overseas and replacing them with jobs that pay you less ...four more years of a go-it-alone foreign policy. If you do, then you should vote for George W. Bush.\nBut if you want health care for all Americans. If you want schools that work. If you want jobs that pay you more money. If you want Social Security that's there for the future. Then we need to move America in a new direction and that's the choice in this election.\nOf all George Bush's wrong choices, the most catastrophic one is the mess in Iraq. It's not that I would have done one thing differently in Iraq, I would have done everything differently. It was wrong to rush to war without a plan to win the peace. It was wrong not to build a strong international coalition of our allies. And it was wrong to put our young men and women into harm's way without the equipment and body armor protect themselves and get the job done.\nIt was wrong for America to go it alone. And now every American is paying the price. Almost all the casualties are the sons and daughters of America. And nearly 90 percent of the cost is coming out of your pocket. The price-tag so far: $200 billion and rising every day. That's $200 billion we're not investing in health care and education That's $200 billion we're not investing to make sure no child is left behind. That's $200 billion we're not investing in new and better jobs.\nThat's $200 billion we're not investing in homeland security, to protect our airports, our subways, our bridges and tunnels. That's W and that's wrong. Wrong choices, wrong direction. In fact, there's nothing right about it.\nAt that convention in New York last week, the Bush Administration actually said that outsourcing jobs is good for this nation. That shouldn't be a surprise because that's what they've done for four years, and that's what they want to do for four more years. That's W and that's Wrong. Wrong choices, wrong direction. It's time for a president who will lead America in a new direction.\nWe're going to set a new direction пїЅ we're going to close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas, and we're going to reward companies that believe that American workers do the best job in the world.\nAt that convention in New York last week, George Bush actually promised the American people that after four years of failure, he now had a plan to get health care costs under control. Well, if you weren't suspicious of a plan announced just two months before an election, you got a quick dose of reality the next day. George Bush socked seniors with a 17 percent increase in Medicare. What's right about that? That's the biggest increase in Medicare premiums in the history of the program. Raising Medicare costs -- that's W and that's wrong. Wrong choices, wrong direction.\nIt's time for a president who will lead America in a new direction.\nWe're going to set a new direction for America. We're going to get health care costs under control. And America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected, it is a right for all Americans.\nAt that convention in New York last week, George Bush said that he actually had a new idea. And you know what it was? The bad, old idea of privatizing social security -- and cutting your benefits. That's W and that's wrong. Wrong choices, wrong direction. It's time for a president who will lead America in a new direction.\nAs President, I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. I will not raise the retirement age. Because when you've worked for a lifetime, America owes you what you've earned.\nAt that convention in New York last week, after four years of catering to the big oil companies and the Saudis, George Bush suddenly said that he wanted America to be energy independent.\nBut he's the one who invited energy company executives to secret meetings in the White House and let them write our energy policies. In 2000, he came right here to West Virginia, and promised $2 billion for clean coal technology. But you know what? He broke that promise, too. There's an old saying -- fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Well, we're not going to be fooled twice.\nThat energy policy -- that's W and that's wrong. Wrong choices, wrong direction. It's time for a president who will lead America in a new direction.\nWe're going to set a new direction for America. We're going to invest in new technologies, like clean coal, and tough health and safety standards to protect miners. We'll invest in the vehicles of the future, so that no young American will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East. I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation, not the Saudi Royal Family.\nOn every issue, from Iraq to health care, from jobs to education, W stands for wrong. Wrong choices. Wrong direction. It's time for a president who will lead America in a new direction.\nThis is Labor Day пїЅ a day specifically set aside to honor work in America. So I'm want to say something else about jobs -- because there's no place where George W Bush is more wrong than on jobs.\nIn the last three years, West Virginia lost 11,000 manufacturing jobs. But just today, a report came out that shows we've replaced those good jobs with low wage jobs пїЅ ones that pay an average of $9,000 less. A lot of them are part-time or temporary and don't provide any health care or benefits. That is wrong. That's George W. Bush and that's why we need a new direction for America.\nBut if you think it's tough to get by on $9,000 less, you haven't heard the half of it. Health care costs are up, tuition is up, child care costs are up, gas prices are up, and family income has fallen. So people are working two jobs, three jobs, working nights and weekends, just to make ends meet.\nFour years ago, George W. Bush told us he wanted to create an economy where there was \"high-paying, high-quality work\" for everyone. He now says prosperity has returned and we've turned the corner. Well, that's just plain wrong. Most Americans I've met feel like they've been put in a corner. Prosperity hasn't returned. We've lost jobs. Wages are down. Benefits are down. And George Bush is the first president since Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression to actually lose jobs. That's George W. Bush. Wrong choices, wrong direction. It's time for a president who will America in a new direction.\nAmazingly, his own Labor Secretary says that what's happening to America is \"something to celebrate.\" What are they celebrating? 1.6 million lost jobs? Well, I don't know about you, but the America I believe in doesn't celebrate when people aren't earning enough to pay their bills...when they don't have any health care or benefits...when they're working so hard that they can't even have dinner with their families, or tuck their kids into bed at night. This isn't that complicated. You don't celebrate when you lose good jobs. You celebrate when you create them.\nIt's time to set a new direction for America's economy. Under my economic plan, when you put in a good day's work, you'll get a good day's pay. Under my plan, we'll create jobs that don't just let you survive, but let you get ahead. And we're going to restore the American dream where hard work and playing by the rules gets rewarded.\nJohn Edwards and I are going to bring those jobs back to America. We'll fight for overtime protections, cut energy costs, and make health care affordable for American families and American employers. And we'll cut the deficit in half in four years by making government live by the rule that every family has to follow: pay as you go пїЅ you don't spend what you don't have.\nSo this election comes down to a fundamental choice: if you believe that this country is heading in the right direction, you should support George Bush. But if you believe a vote for W is a vote for wrong choices and the wrong direction, then join with us. If you believe we need good jobs, health care for all, energy independence, and a smarter plan for Iraq, then stand with us to move America in a new direction.\nTogether, we can build an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-09-06", "title": "Remarks in Racine, West Virginia"}

Yesterday, we reached a tragic milestone. More than 1,000 of America's sons and daughters gave their lives in service to our country. More than 1,000 sons and daughters, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters who will never come home to live the lives they dreamed of. We honor them, we pray for them and for their families, and we owe it to their memory and all our troops to do what's right in Iraq.\nI also want to speak directly to the more than 150,000 troops currently risking their lives as far away as Iraq and Afghanistan. Your country is proud of you. You are the most dedicated, capable military we've ever had. We are united as a nation in our support for you. We pledge to stand with your families as you stand on the front lines for ours. You are the best of America. And you perform magnificently every day. We thank you for your service and your sacrifice.\nTwenty-three months ago, President Bush came here to ask the American people for our support. And he promised then to make the right choices when it came to sending young Americans to Iraq.\nHere in Cincinnati, he said that if Congress approved the resolution giving him the authority to use force, it did not mean that military action would be \"unavoidable\". But he chose not to give the weapons inspectors the time they needed to get the job done and give meaning to the words, going to war as a last resort.\nHere in Cincinnati, he promised \"to lead a coalition.\" But he failed to build a broad, strong coalition of allies and he rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.\nHere in Cincinnati, from this hall, on that night, he spoke to the nation, and promised: \"If we have to act, we will take every precaution that is possible. We will plan carefully. We will act with the full power of the United States military. We will act with allies at our side and we will prevail.\"\nBut then, George W. Bush made the wrong choices. He himself now admits he miscalculated in Iraq. In truth, his miscalculation was ignoring the advice that was given to him, including the best advice of America's own military. When he didn't like what he was hearing, he even fired the Army Chief of Staff. His miscalculation was going to war without taking every precaution and without giving the inspectors time. His miscalculation was going to war without planning carefully and without the allies we should have had. As a result, America has paid nearly 90% of the bill in Iraq. Contrast that with the Gulf War, where our allies paid 95% of the costs.\nGeorge W. Bush's wrong choices have led America in the wrong direction in Iraq and left America without the resources we need here at home. The cost of the President's go-it-alone policy in Iraq is now $200 billion and counting. $200 billion for Iraq, but they tell us we can't afford after-school programs for our children. $200 billion for Iraq, but they tell us we can't afford health care for our veterans. $200 billion for Iraq, but they tell us we can't afford to keep the 100,000 new police we put on the streets during the 1990s.\nWell we're here today to tell them: they're wrong. And it's time to lead America in a new direction.\nWhen it comes to Iraq, it's not that I would have done one thing differently from the President, I would've done almost everything differently. I would have given the inspectors the time they needed before rushing to war. I would have built a genuine coalition of our allies around the world. I would've made sure that every soldier put in harm's way had the equipment and body armor they needed. I would've listened to the senior military leaders of this country and the bipartisan advice of Congress. And, if there's one thing I learned from my own service, I would never have gone to war without a plan to win the peace.\nI would not have made the wrong choices that are forcing us to pay nearly the entire cost of this war – $200 billion that we're not investing in education, health care, and job creation here at home.\n$200 billion for going-it-alone in Iraq. That's the wrong choice; that's the wrong direction; and that's the wrong leadership for America.\nWhile we're spending that $200 billion in Iraq, 8 million Americans are looking for work – 2 million more than when George W. Bush took office – and we're told that we can't afford to invest in job training and job creation here at home.\nBut for the Bush administration, helping Americans find a good job has never been the priority. The first time we've heard much about it at all was during this campaign. And at that convention in New York last week, they actually told us that outsourcing jobs was good for America. That shouldn't be a surprise because that's what they've been doing for four years – and if they get another chance, that's exactly what they will do for four more years. That's the wrong choice; that's the wrong direction; and that's the wrong leadership for America.\nAs president, I will set a new direction. I will close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas. Instead, we're going to reward companies that create and keep good jobs here in the United States of America.\nBecause of this President's wrong choices, we're spending $200 billion in Iraq while the costs of health care have gone through the roof and we're told we don't have the resources to make health care affordable and available for all Americans. Today, 45 million Americans have no health insurance at all – 5 million more than the day George W. Bush took office.\nAnd after four years of no action, no concern, and hardly a mention of those struggling to afford health care, the President finally told us last week that he actually had a plan. Well, we only had to wait twenty-four hours to find out what that was. Because the very next day he raised Medicare premiums 17 percent – the biggest increase in Medicare premiums in the history of that program. And here's the kicker – a lot of that money is nothing more than a windfall to the insurance companies and HMOs. They're charging 17% more for Medicare while making America pay $200 billion for a go-it-alone policy in Iraq. That's the wrong choice; that's the wrong direction; and that's the wrong leadership for America.\nAs President, I will set a new direction. George W. Bush believes when it comes to health care, the big drug companies come first, the insurance companies come second, and you come last. Well, I'm going to put you first. Our plan will take on the waste and greed in the health care system and save the average family up to $1000 a year on their premiums. Our plan will help small businesses deal with the most expensive cases. Our plan will cover all children. When I am president, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected, it is a right for all Americans.\nBecause of George W. Bush's wrong choices, we're spending $200 billion in Iraq while we're running up deficits that threaten Social Security. In fact, they're raiding the Social Security Trust Fund to pay for their mistakes in Iraq. At that convention in New York last week, George Bush said that he actually had a new idea. And you know what it was? The bad, old idea of privatizing social security -- and cutting your benefits. That's the wrong choice; that's the wrong direction; and that's the wrong leadership for America.\nAs President, I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. I will not raise the retirement age. Because when you've worked for a lifetime, America owes you what you've earned.\nAnd because of this President's wrong choices, we're spending $200 billion in Iraq instead of investing in making America energy independent. George W. Bush's energy policy is to trust the big oil companies and the Saudis. In fact, a national news magazine just reported that a senior member of the Saudi Royal family said that as far as they're concerned, in the U.S. Presidential election, \"It's Bush all the way.\" I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation, not the Saudi Royal Family.\nWe're going to invest in technology and the vehicles of the future, so that no young American will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East. That's the right choice; that's the right direction; and that's the right leadership for America.\nBecause of this President's wrong choices, we're spending $200 billion in Iraq while we're told that we can't afford to do everything that we should for homeland security. I believe it's wrong to be opening firehouses in Baghdad and closing them down in the United States of America. It's wrong to cut money for our first responders. It's wrong to let 95% of the cargo that comes into this country get by without ever being physically inspected. That's the wrong choice; that's the wrong direction; and that's the wrong leadership for America.\nAs President, I will set a new direction. We're going to defend this country here at home. We're going to do all we possibly can to protect it from another terrorist attack. And we're going to make homeland security a priority, not a political slogan.\nMy friends, today we are bearing the cost of the war in Iraq almost alone – $200 billion and counting.\nNearly two years after George W. Bush spoke to the nation from this very place, we know how wrong his choices were. He says he \"miscalculated.\" He calls Iraq a \"catastrophic success.\" But a glance at the front pages or a look at the nightly news shows the hard reality: Rising instability. Spreading violence. Growing extremism. Havens for terrorists that weren't there before. And today, even the Pentagon admits, Entire regions of Iraq are controlled by insurgents and terrorists.\nI call this course a catastrophic choice that has cost us $200 billion because we went it alone, and we've paid an even more unbearable price in young American lives.\nWe need a new direction. I know what we need to do in Iraq. We need to bring our allies to our side, share the burdens, reduce the cost to American taxpayers, and reduce the risk to American soldiers. We need to train Iraqi military and police – we need to train them more rapidly, more effectively, and in greater numbers to take over the job of protecting their own country. That's what I'll do as Commander-in-Chief – because that's the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home.\nYou know, the President said one thing in his convention speech that's true. He said we all need to challenge the soft bigotry of low expectations. But you know, it's George W. Bush who has set low expectations -- and met them. He doesn't believe that America can be strong in the world while we also make progress here at home. He believes we have to choose one or the other. That's a false choice – and I reject it. I believe we can lead in the world and lead America to greater progress and prosperity than we've ever known before.\nHalf a century ago, from here in Union Terminal, thousands of soldiers waved one last goodbye to their families before heading off to the Second World War. In that war, their bravery, and leaders who made the right choices, brought victory over tyranny and prosperity here at home.\nWhen I'm president, America will once again stand up to our enemies without destroying or denying our best hopes here at home. We will strengthen our military to meet new threats and we will build and lead strong alliances. We will build a stronger America, with good jobs, better wages, health care for all, and energy independence. With the right choices and the right leadership, we will set a new direction for America. We will build an America stronger at home and respected in the world. As Franklin Roosevelt once said, \"The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.\" Well, I believe there are no limits for tomorrow. But we need to make the right choices today. With your help, we will restore the true greatness of our nation and set a new direction for our future.\nThank you, God bless you, and God Bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-09-08", "title": "Remarks in Cincinnati, Ohio"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29724", "text": "Through many dangers, toils and snares, I have already come; ‘Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far, And grace will lead me home.\nThank you Reverend Shaw for that gracious introduction and thank you all for giving me this opportunity to speak to this great convention. I opened with a stanza from \"Amazing Grace.\" It was my father's favorite hymn and probably many of yours, too. And I know that in the next seven weeks, as we seek the America of our dreams, we will need every voice and every vote in this room and all across this broad land to bring this election home. And I know, as you do, that we cannot finish that journey and reach the mountaintop without the blessings of amazing grace.\nSo many of you know the story of how an English slave trader named John Newton was inspired to write that hymn as his ship was battered and tossed in the midst of a violent storm while he was on a slave trading voyage. It was then and there that he decided to give his life to God. When he returned home, he became a minister and an abolitionist. His life shows us that faith can calm troubled waters and that amazing grace will always bring us home.\nThe National Baptist Convention has lived that lived that truth throughout your history. In your individual churches and as a collective body, as you quietly go about your mission everyday -- feeding the hungry, clothing the naked and nourishing the soul of our nation, you are turning faith into deeds and making a difference in the lives of millions of Americans. Some people want to take credit for the faith-based service that you've been doing for years. They want to turn it into a political issue. But we know that you've been working in partnership with government and community-based organizations for years to bring hope to communities across our country. And on this eve of the third anniversary of September the 11th, 2001, I want to offer a special thanks to Rev. Shaw and the entire membership of the National Baptist Convention for your amazing deeds in the aftermath of that tragedy. I especially thank you for your contribution to the families of the Vulcan Society firefighters of New York who, on September 11th, gave their lives so that others might live.\nYour dedication and your service live out the teaching of the Scripture: \"It is not enough, my brother, to say you have faith, when there are no deeds...Faith without works is dead.\" As you know, my friends, we are taught to walk by faith not by sight.\nAnd when we look around us – when we look around neighborhoods and towns and cities all across this country, we see faith to be lived out, and so many deeds to be done.\nAs it's said, faith is the substance of things hoped for, evidence of things not seen. [Hebrews 11:1] And we all know, you can't separate faith from substance.\nWe see jobs to be created. We see families to house. We see violence to stop. We see children to teach – and children to care for. We see too many people without health care and too many people of color suffering and dying from diseases like AIDS and cancer and diabetes.\nWe look at what is happening in America today and forget to ask: Where are the deeds? Where is the substance in our faith?\nFifty years ago, with the decision in Brown v. the Board of Education, this nation had a great moment of conscience. A moment when we finally acknowledged God's truth that we are each made in His image and likeness – that separate but equal is not just unequal – but immoral.\nI will never forget the lessons I learned from the Reverend John Walker, the first African-American teacher at my high school. He taught me that the real gift of the civil rights movement was not progress for African Americans because of the benevolence of white Americans, but progress for all Americans because of the courageous efforts of a multi-racial coalition of conscience -- led by Black ministers and white ministers, young and old, South and North -- countless unsung heroes determined to bring about a better day.\nIn the hardest passages of the long march for civil rights -- amid lynchings and beatings and unyielding discrimination, the stalwart foot soldiers of justice did not look around and say, as we have heard so often from Washington these days, that we've turned the corner or that the job was getting done or that this was the best that we could do. Like us, they were a generation of optimists. They believed that America's best days lay ahead...that America could always do better. Against all odds, they saw a new dawn of liberty. They had a dream of a more perfect union – a dream of one America.\nBut that dream – our dream – is dim and denied in the Washington of today. 140 years after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, it is time to again emancipate this land, to live up to our ideals; it is time for a new moment of conscience in America.\nThe fact is, the wrong choices of the Bush Administration – reduced taxes for the few and reduced opportunities for the middle class and those struggling to join it – are taking us back to two Americas -- separate and unequal. Our cities and communities are being torn apart by forces just as divisive and destructive as Jim Crow – crumbling schools robbing our children of their potential...rising poverty...rising crime, drugs and violence. I say again: Where are the deeds? Where is the substance in our faith?\nFour years ago, George Bush came to office calling himself a \"compassionate conservative.\" Well, in the story of the Good Samaritan we are told of two men who pass by or cross to the other side of the street when they come upon a robbed and beaten man. They felt compassion, but there were no deeds. Then the Good Samaritan gave both his heart and his help. [Luke 10]\nIt is clear: For four years, George W. Bush may have talked about compassion, but he's walked right by. He's seen people in need, but he's crossed over to the other side of the street.\nAs I have traveled this land, I've thought a lot about why America is heading in the wrong direction. Lost jobs, health care costs through the roof, the surplus gone, our alliances shredded, our influence challenged.\nWell, as the president likes to say, there's nothing complicated about it. It all comes down to one letter -- W. So the next time you hear George W. Bush, remember the W stands for wrong. Wrong choices for Americans, and the wrong direction for America. This election all comes down to one decision: Do we want four more years of wrong choices for our country, or do we want to move America in a new direction?\nOf all George Bush's wrong choices, the most catastrophic one is the mess he's made in Iraq. It's not that I would have done one thing differently in Iraq, I would have done almost everything differently. It was wrong to rush to war without a plan to win the peace. It was wrong not to build a strong international coalition of our allies.\nAnd because we went it alone, we are bearing the burden and paying almost any price almost alone. Almost all the casualties are the sons and daughters of America. And 90 percent of the costs are being met by Americans – the total so far: $200 billion and rising every day. That's $200 billion we're not investing in health care and education That's $200 billion we're not investing to make sure no child is left behind. That's $200 billion we're not investing in incentives to create and keep good jobs in the United States of America. That's $200 billion we're not investing in homeland security to keep cops on the street, to protect our airports, our subways, our bridges and tunnels. That's W. Wrong choices, wrong direction, wrong leadership for America.\nAt that convention in New York last week, the Bush Administration actually said that outsourcing jobs is good for this nation. That shouldn't be a surprise because that's what they've done for four years, and, if they have the chance, that's what they will do for four more years. In the last three years, America has lost 1.6 million jobs. And just this week, a report showed that we've replaced those good jobs with low wage jobs – ones that pay an average of $9,000 less. A lot of them are part-time or temporary and don't provide any health care or benefits. And African-American unemployment is nearly 10 percent – double the rate for whites. That's more than a twenty-five percent increase since George Bush took office.\nMy friends, the promise of a better America is not being met when nearly one in three African American children are living in poverty or when half the black men in New York City are out of work. Here in Louisiana, the poverty rate is more than 20 percent – the highest in the nation. Is that compassionate? No.\nFor every complex problem there's a simple answer. And it's almost always wrong.\nThat's W. Wrong choices, wrong direction, wrong leadership for America.\nAs President, I will set a new direction. We're going to close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas. Instead, we're going to use common sense. We're going to reward companies that create and keep good jobs here in America.\nAt that convention in New York last week, George Bush actually promised the American people that after four years of failure, he now had a plan to get health care costs under control. Well, we only had to wait twenty-four hours to find out what he meant. The day after he spoke, he raised Medicare premiums by 17 percent -- the biggest increase in Medicare premiums in the history of the program.\nUnder the Bush Administration, 5 million Americans have lost their health insurance, including 400,000 African Americans. People of color are significantly more likely to suffer diseases like cancer and asthma and diabetes and AIDS. And yet nearly 60 percent of Hispanics and 43 percent of African Americans went without health coverage for all or part of the last two years. Is that compassionate?\nGeorge W. Bush believes when it comes to health care, the big drug companies come first, the insurance companies come second, and you come last. Well, that's W. Wrong choices, wrong direction, wrong leadership for America.\nAs President, I will set a new direction. I'm going to put you first. Our plan will take on the waste and greed in the health care system and save the average family up to $1,000 a year on their premiums. Our plan will help small businesses deal with the most expensive cases. Our plan will cover all children – automatically -- day one. Go to school, you're covered. Go to day care, you're enrolled. Every child in America will be covered. It's a long time overdue. When I am president, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected, it is a right for all Americans.\nAt that convention in New York last week, George Bush said that he actually had a new idea. And you know what it was? The bad, old idea of privatizing social security -- and cutting your benefits. That's W. Wrong choices, wrong direction, wrong leadership for America. As President, I will set a new direction.\nLet me say it plainly: I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. I will not raise the retirement age. Because when you've worked for a lifetime, America owes you what you've earned.\nAt that convention in New York last week, George Bush actually talked about demanding accountability from everybody in education -- except his own administration. We know that you can't really get the job done in our classrooms when too many children, especially children of color, are forced to attend overcrowded and crumbling schools and are being taught by overworked and underpaid teachers. The promise of a better America is not being met when only 50 percent of African Americans are finishing high school and only 18 percent are graduating college. The promise of a better America is not being met, when, fifty years after Brown, in too many parts of our country we still have two school systems – separate and unequal.\nThat's W. Wrong choices, wrong direction, wrong leadership for America.\nAs President, I will set a new direction. We know the answer to closing the achievement gap is both higher expectations and greater resources. You cannot promise to leave no child behind and then leave the money behind. John Edwards and I have a plan to invest in our future, provide the needed funding and put a good teacher in every classroom – so that all our children will have the chance to develop their God-given potential.\nYou know, I used to be a prosecutor. I sent criminals to jail for murder and rape for the rest of their lives. But I also spent a lot of time talking to kids in trouble. There wasn't one of those kids I met who didn't come from a place of neglect, a background of abuse, poverty or violence. They are where they are because adults weren't able – or just weren't doing – what they should have been. We can't be a nation that abandons our children. Our promise will never be met until we stop being a nation content to spend $50,000 a year to keep a young person in prison for the rest of their life, when we could invest $10,000 to give them Head Start, Early Start, Smart Start, the best possible start in life.\nFifty years after the Brown decision, we are also reminded that now, more than ever, we need a Supreme Court that will protect our hard won victories.\nIt was just four short years ago that the Court – by one vote – decided the outcome of the race for president. It was less than a year ago that the Court – by one vote – decided the fate of affirmative action. One vote can make the difference for millions of Americans, and over the next four years the President of the United States will appoint as many as four Supreme Court justices.\nGeorge W. Bush has said that Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas are the kind of judges he will put on the Supreme Court. Make no mistake – justices like them are out of the mainstream, and we don't need more of them on the Court. But that's W. Wrong choices, wrong direction, wrong leadership for America.\nWe have fought too hard and come too far to let George W. Bush roll back generations of progress. John Edwards and I know that the whole future of civil rights and affirmative action may hinge on a single Supreme Court vote.\nAnd that bring me to another fundamental choice in this election: The other side says that a million African American votes not counted, continuing acts of voter suppression and the most tainted election in American history is the best that we can do. That's W. That's wrong. And we're not going to let it happen again. This time, we will fight to make sure every vote is counted and every vote counts. And we are already on the ground in Florida and elsewhere to make sure that nothing stands in the way.\nWe have many deeds to do here at home. But to keep the faith, we also have to set a new direction for America's leadership in the world. The U.S. and the UN Security Council now face a testing moment of truth – they must decide whether to take action to halt the killing in Darfur or remain idle in the face of the second African genocide in 10 years. If I were president, I would act now. As I've said for months, I would not sit idly by. We simply cannot accept another Rwanda. The United States should ensure the immediate deployment of an effective international force to disarm militia, protect civilians, and facilitate delivery of humanitarian assistance in Darfur. The Sudanese government has thus far rejected such force. The US should lead the United Nations to impose tough sanctions now and make plain, we will not accept Khartoum continuing to block its deployment. And the President should immediately appoint an American Ambassador to the African Union, as we have long had an Ambassador to the European Union. The United States should not treat Africa as a second-class continent.\nI also know that George Bush has asked the question, \"Does the Democratic Party take African American voters for granted?\" Well, here is my answer. The Book of Matthew reminds us, \"Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing.\" [Matthew 7:15]. The president who in the last four years couldn't even find time to meet with NAACP... the Black Caucus ... or the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. The president who turns away from African American needs...who scorns economic justice and affirmative action...who traffics in the politics of division – and then claims he is a friend of Black America can not conceal his identity no matter what clothes he wears. And here is the other part of my answer: We will march with you every step of the way to full equality for all Americans. This November we're going to have a new march on Washington to bring your voice and our concerns right to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I'm ready to march with you. Will you march with me?\nTogether, we can close the gaps of inequality that impede the progress of our nation. Together, we can stop being what W.E.B. DuBois called, \"a nation within a nation,\" and what John Edwards and I have called two Americas. Some have questioned this idea. But, Mr. President, I ask you to spend time with struggling families in the hills of Appalachia ... or in public housing in Detroit ... or in the barrios of East LA and then tell me our journey to build one America is finished. Our job, between now and November is to end the division between the fortunate America and the forgotten America. We must come to together to build one America.\nOn issue after issue, the other side has been trying to muddy the waters to keep you from seeing the real differences and the real choices in this election. The Bible tells us that we must sometimes see through a glass darkly. But on every issue, from Iraq to health care, from jobs to education to America's role in the world, the choice is clear. If you believe that this country is heading in the right direction, you should support George Bush. But if you believe a vote for W is a vote for the wrong choices, wrong direction, and the wrong leadership for America, then join with us. If you believe we need good jobs, health care for all, energy independence, and a new direction in Iraq, then I ask you to stand with us for an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.\nMy friends, this is the most important election of our lifetime. Everything is on the line: our jobs, our health care, our role in the world, the character of our country – the Supreme Court of the United States. And while you have heard this many times before, we all know that the black community can help lead the way. We can't afford to take any vote for granted – and we won't. We can't afford to sit this one out or leave it up to our neighbor – and we won't.\nWe have 54 days left until the election. The clock is ticking. Together, we can make the right choices. We can come together. We can fulfill the promise of a better America. There are those who want to divide us into red states and blue states. Not me. I want to unite us as one America – red, white and blue. With your help, we will set a new direction for America.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2004-09-09", "title": "Remarks to the 124th Annual Session of the National Baptist Convention in New Orleans"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29725", "text": "Good morning, this is John Kerry.\nThree years ago today, on a bright September morning, a young couple took their three-year old daughter on her first airplane flight – American Flight 11, from Boston to Los Angeles. On that morning, a security guard stood watch at the World Trade Center, proud that in just six days, he would become an American citizen. He had already told his wife to wear her nicest dress to the ceremony. On that morning, a firefighter left his pregnant wife, and reported for duty at Rescue Company 4 to fill in for someone else. It was supposed to be his day off.\nOn September 11, 2001, they and nearly 3,000 others were living out the daily rhythm of life in a nation at peace. But on that morning, in a single moment, they were lost, and our land was changed forever.\nIn the hours after the attacks, we drew strength from firefighters who ran up the stairs and risked their lives so that others might live. From rescuers who rushed into smoke and fire at the Pentagon. From the men and women of Flight 93 who sacrificed themselves to save our nation's Capitol. They didn't think twice. They didn't look back. And their courage lifted our nation.\nThat was just the beginning. In the days that followed, we saw an outpouring of love as people across America and around the world asked themselves, \"What can I do to help?\" How can I, as the Scripture says, help repair the breach? [Isaiah 58:12]\nIn Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania, Christians and Jews came together to attend services at a local mosque. They came to support their Muslim friends and neighbors – and together, they prayed as one.\nThe people of Akron, Ohio wanted to do something for the firefighters of New York. So they dug deep into their pockets and donated enough money to buy a fire truck, two ambulances, and three police cars.\nAnd in Reno, Nevada, two little girls started a penny drive to help the families of the victims. They hoped, as one of them put it, to \"make their hearts feel better.\"\nSo while September 11th was the worst day this nation has ever seen, it brought out the best in all of us.\nI know that for those who lost loved ones that day, the past three years have been almost unbearable. Their courage and faith have been tested in a way they never imagined. But day after day, they have held on. And day after day, they and we have found hope and comfort and strength by the quiet grace of God.\nWe are one America in our prayers for those who were taken from us on September 11th and for their families. And we are one America in our unbending determination to defend our country – to find and get the terrorists before they get us.\nA poet once wrote that those who have left us \"...have a silence that speaks for them at night...They say: our deaths are not ours; they are yours; they will mean what you make them...They say: we leave you our deaths. Give them their meaning.\"\nIn the past three years, with countless acts of bravery and kindness – large and small – Americans have given meaning to those lives. That terrible day has renewed our sense of purpose. And in the years ahead we will share its lessons with our children and grandchildren. We will tell them that on September 11th, ordinary men and women became heroes at a moment's notice – and so can you. We will tell them that we were strong because we took care of each other – and so can you. We will tell them that we came together in tragedy, chose confidence over fear, and that our love for America far outshone the darkness of those who hate us.\nFinally, we will tell them that on September 11th and the days that followed, we learned in the hardest way possible that the American spirit endures. It is that spirit which leads us to defy the terrorists and affirm that freedom will win. It is that spirit which sustains the families of September 11th as they rebuild their lives. And it is that spirit which will guide us as we rebuild those towers – stronger, higher, and more beautiful than ever before. Just like America.\nThanks for listening.", "timestamp": "2004-09-11", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation"}

On that morning, a man from a tiny town just west of here, reported for work in the World Trade Center. He had just gotten a promotion. He had just married the love of his life. And everyone back home was so proud. On that morning, a gentle priest beloved by his parish boarded United Flight 175 to visit his sister in California. One of his parishioners later said he thought God put him on that plane to give comfort to those on board.\nFor each of you here time stopped in a way that has made memories of that day three years ago forever fresh, forever painful. I know this because some of you were part of my life before that day, and many of you have become part of it since.\nOn September 11, 2001, your loved ones and nearly 3,000 others were living out the daily rhythm of life in a nation at peace. And on that morning, in a single moment, they were lost, and our world changed forever.\nIn the hours after the attacks, we drew strength from firefighters who ran up the stairs and risked their lives so that others might live. From rescuers who rushed into smoke and fire at the Pentagon. From the men and women of Flight 93 who sacrificed themselves to save our nation's Capitol. They didn't think twice. They didn't look back. And their courage lifted our nation. On that day, we all drew strength from each other.\nAnd that was just the beginning. In the days that followed, we saw an outpouring of love as people here in Massachusetts and across America asked themselves, \"What can I do to help?\"\nIn Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania, Christians and Jews came together to attend services at a local mosque. They came to support their Muslim friends and neighbors – and together, they prayed as one.\nIn Reno, Nevada, two little girls started a penny drive to help the families of the victims. They hoped, as one of them put it, to \"make their hearts feel better.\"\nAnd here in Massachusetts, we saw candlelight vigils and prayer services. We saw people standing in line for hours to donate blood. And we saw doctors, rescuers and EMT's hop into their cars on a moment's notice and drive to New York City to help.\nSo while September 11th was the worst day we have ever seen, it brought out the best in all of us. We will always remember where we were on that day. And we must always remember that we will only defeat those who sought to destroy us by standing together as one America.\nI know that for all of you who lost loved ones on September 11th, these last three years have been hard ones. I know that your courage and faith have been tested in ways you never imagined. And in ways that are hard for others to understand. I know you've had times when you've wondered how you were going to make it through – how you were going to make it to the next day, the next week, the next month. But hour after hour, you held on. And hour after hour, you have found hope and comfort and strength by the love of those around you and the quiet grace of God. And for that, we are all grateful.\nA poet once wrote that those who have left us \"...have a silence that speaks for them at night...They say: our deaths are not ours; they are yours; they will mean what you make them...They say: we leave you our deaths. Give them their meaning.\"\nIn the past three years, with countless acts of bravery and kindness – large and small – all of you have given and continue to give meaning to those lives. That's the gift of the elegant and graceful memorial in Boston Garden.\nIn the years ahead, all of us will complete this mission as we share the lessons of September 11th with our children and grandchildren. We will tell them that on September 11th, ordinary men and women became heroes at a moment's notice – and so can you. We will tell them that we were strong because we took care of each other – and so can you. We will tell them that we came together in tragedy, chose confidence over fear, and that our love for America far outshines the darkness of those who hate.\nFinally, we will tell them that on September 11th and the days that followed, we learned in the hardest way possible that the American spirit endures. It is that spirit which leads us to defy those who would harm us, and affirm that freedom will win. It is that spirit which sustains all of you as you continue to rebuild your lives. And it is that spirit which will guide us all as we rebuild those towers – stronger, higher, and more beautiful than ever before. Just like America.\nThank you, may God bless you, and may God bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-09-11", "title": "Remarks at the Massachusetts 9/11 Fund Third Anniversary Commemoration in Boston"}

Three years ago today, 3,000 innocent people were lost in the worst day we've ever seen.\nToday has been a day of remembrance and tribute. But what really matters is what we do tomorrow and the day after to honor their lives. We honor their lives by never forgetting what they meant to us. We honor their lives by bringing their killers to justice and making sure this never happens again. And we honor their lives in the work we do every day to build a stronger America.\nThat's why you're here. That's what the CBC is all about.\nAnd that's why I'm running for president.\nI don't have to tell you -- this is the most important election of our lifetime. Everything is on the line: our jobs, our health care, our role in the world, the character of our country – the Supreme Court of the United States. The stakes are high and the choices are clear.\nOn issue after issue, the other side has been trying to muddy the waters to keep us from seeing the real differences and the real choices in this election.\nBut on every issue, from Iraq to Social Security, from fiscal discipline to education, from voting rights to affirmative action, we know the truth. And John Edwards and I are going to fight every day to show the difference between their tired, old, negative politics of the past and a new direction for America.\nNobody understands those differences more than the 39 members of the Congressional Black Caucus. You live with those choices every day and you see the impact they're having on our families and communities. You see the impact they have on your ability to legislate and to represent the people you serve back home. And in this room are some of the best ideas to make our nation stronger. But over the last four years, you've been shut out of the debate. They've refused you meetings and put a \"do not enter\" sign on the White House door.\nWell, my friends, it's time to open the doors and let all Americans back in. Because we deserve a president who doesn't just meet with the people he agrees with. And we deserve a president who's not afraid to sit down with the NAACP, the Black Caucus or the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. We deserve a president who wants to sit down with them and recognizes how important it is to governing our country. We deserve a president who doesn't go to Dr. King's gravesite one day and the next day appoints a right-wing judge to the federal court. When I'm president, no one's going to have to twist my arm to remind me that your voices matter and they must be heard.\nWe've been partners on the legislative battlefield for a long time now. Long before this president showed up, we've been fighting to bring hope and opportunity to those who for too long have been left out. Long before this president recognized the global threat of AIDS, we worked together to meet this challenge with the moral and economic might of America.\nYour dedication and your service live out the teaching of the Scripture in ways that others should take example from: \"It is not enough, my brother, to say you have faith, when there are no deeds...Faith without works is dead.\" As you know, my friends, we are taught to walk by faith not by sight.\nAnd when we look around us – when we look around our neighborhoods and towns and cities all across this country, we see faith to be lived out, and so many deeds to be done.\nWe see jobs to be created. We see families to house. We see violence to stop. We see children to teach – and children to care for. We see too many people without health care and too many people of color suffering and dying from diseases like AIDS and cancer and diabetes.\nWe look at what is happening in America today and are forced to ask: Where are the deeds?\nThe fact is, the wrong choices of the Bush Administration – reduced taxes for the few and reduced opportunities for the middle class and those struggling to join it – are taking us back to two Americas -- separate and unequal. Our cities and communities are being torn apart by divisive and destructive forces: crumbling schools robbing our children of their potential...rising poverty...rising crime, drugs and violence. Lost jobs, health care costs through the roof, the surplus gone, our alliances shredded, our influence challenged.\nThey see what we see but their answer is to say we've turned the corner or that the job is getting done or that this is the best that we can do. They've even mocked the very notion that there are two Americas. Well, they should spend time with struggling families in the hills of Appalachia ... or in public housing in Detroit ... or in the barrios of East LA and then tell us our journey to build one America is finished.\nAs Congressman Jefferson knows, a few days ago I had the pleasure of speaking to the 124th annual session of the National Baptist Convention in New Orleans. I reminded them that four years ago, this president came to office calling himself a \"compassionate conservative.\" Well in the story of the Good Samaritan, we are told of two men who pass by or cross to the other side of the street when they come upon a robbed and beaten man. They felt compassion, but there were no deeds. Then the Good Samaritan gave both his heart and his help. [Luke 10]\nIt is clear: For four years, this president has talked about compassion, but he's walked right by. He's seen people in need, but he's crossed over to the other side of the street. For four years, we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values are not just words. They're what we live by. They're about the causes we champion and the choices we make.\nThis election all comes down to one decision: Do we want four more years of wrong choices for our country, or do we want to move America in a new direction?\nOf all the president's wrong choices, the most catastrophic one is the mess he's made in Iraq. It's not that I would have done one thing differently in Iraq, I would have done almost everything differently. It was wrong to rush to war without a plan to win the peace. It was wrong not to build a strong international coalition of our allies.\nAnd because we went it alone, we are bearing the burden and paying almost all the cost by ourselves. Almost all the casualties are the sons and daughters of America. And 90 percent of the costs are being met by Americans – the total so far: $200 billion and rising every day. That's $200 billion we're not investing in health care and education That's $200 billion we're not investing to make sure no child is left behind. That's $200 billion we're not investing in incentives to create and keep good jobs in the United States of America. That's $200 billion we're not investing in homeland security to keep cops on the street, to protect our airports, our subways, our bridges and tunnels. Is that compassionate? Is that the right choice? Well, 52 days from now we're going to move America in a new direction.\nAt that convention in New York, the Bush Administration actually said that outsourcing jobs is good for this nation. That shouldn't be a surprise because that's what they've done for four years, and, if they have the chance, that's what they will do for four more years. In the last three years, America has lost 1.6 million jobs. And African-American unemployment is nearly 10 percent – double the rate for whites. That's more than a twenty-five percent increase since this president took office.\nMy friends, the promise of a better America is not being met when in the last year alone, a million more people have fallen into poverty...when one-third of African American children are living in poverty or when half the black men in New York City are out of work. Is that compassionate? Is that right? Well, 52 days from now we're going to move America in a new direction.\nIt has been said before, but it is so true: The best poverty program is a job. That is why, as President, I will set a new direction. We're going to close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas. Instead, we're going to use common sense and reward companies that create and keep good jobs here in America. And we are going to do more to bring hope and jobs and businesses back to our hardest-pressed urban and metropolitan areas.\nAt that convention in New York, this president actually promised the American people that after four years of failure, he now had a plan to get health care costs under control. Well, if you weren't suspicious enough of a plan announced two months before an election, we only had to wait twenty-four hours to find out what he meant. The day after he spoke, he raised Medicare premiums by 17 percent -- the biggest increase in Medicare premiums in the history of the program.\nUnder the Bush Administration, 5 million Americans have lost their health insurance, including 400,000 African Americans. We know that people of color are significantly more likely to suffer diseases like cancer and asthma and diabetes and AIDS. And what's this administration's answer? At a time when the need is greatest, they have cut funding for Medicaid and children's health insurance. Instead of working to close disparities, they have closed the Office of Minority Health at CDC. That's the wrong choice and the wrong direction for America.\nThis president believes when it comes to health care, the big drug companies come first, the insurance companies come second, and the American people come last. That's the wrong choice and the wrong direction for America.\nAs President, I will set a new direction. I'm going to put hard working families first. Our plan will take on the waste and greed in the health care system and save the average family up to $1,000 a year on their premiums. Our plan will cover all children – automatically -- day one. Go to school, you're covered. Go to day care, you're enrolled. Every child in America will be covered. When I am president, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected, it is a right for all Americans.\nAt that convention in New York, this president actually talked about demanding accountability from everybody in education -- except his own administration. We know that you can't really get the job done in our classrooms when too many children, especially children of color, are forced to attend overcrowded and crumbling schools and are being taught by overworked and underpaid teachers. The promise of a better America is not being met when only 50 percent of African Americans are finishing high school and only 18 percent are graduating college. The promise of a better America is not being met, when, fifty years after Brown v. the Board of Education, in too many parts of our country we still have two school systems – separate and unequal. That's the wrong choice and the wrong direction – and we're going to change it.\nAs President, I will set a new direction. We know the answer to closing the achievement gap is both higher expectations and greater resources. You cannot promise to leave no child behind and then leave the money behind. John Edwards and I have a plan to invest in our future, provide the needed funding and put a good teacher in every classroom – so that all our children will have the chance to develop their God-given potential.\nFifty years after the Brown decision, we are also reminded that now, more than ever, we need a Supreme Court that will protect our hard won victories.\nIt was just four short years ago that the Court – by one vote – decided the outcome of the race for president. It was less than a year ago that the Court – by one vote – decided the fate of affirmative action. One vote can make the difference for millions of Americans, and over the next four years the President of the United States may well appoint as many as four Supreme Court justices. I will appoint judges who follow the Potter Stewart standard, \"The mark of a good judge is a judge whose opinion you can read and have no idea if the judge was a man or a woman, Republican or Democrat, a Christian or a Jew. You just know he or she was a good judge.\"\nAnd good judges know that the right to vote is the most sacred of all American rights. Good judges will stand up for the Voting Rights Act – and so must we. Let me make one thing clear: We're not going to stand by and allow another million African American votes to go uncounted in this election. We're not going to stand by and allow acts of voter suppression.\nWe are hearing the same things you are hearing. What they did in Florida in 2000, they may be planning to do in battleground states all across this country this year. Well, we are here to let them know that we will fight tooth and nail to make sure that this time, every vote is counted and every vote counts.\nWe have many deeds to do here at home. But we must also set a new direction for America's leadership in the world. The U.S. and the UN Security Council now face a testing moment of truth – they must decide whether to take action to halt the killing in Darfur or remain idle in the face of the second African genocide in 10 years.\nNow that the Secretary Powell has finally acknowledged that genocide is underway, we all want to know one thing: what is President Bush going to do about it? The toothless resolution the Bush Administration brought to the Security Council is not an acceptable response.\nIf I were president, I would act now. As I've said for months, I would not sit idly by. We simply cannot accept another Rwanda. The United States should ensure the immediate deployment of an effective international force to disarm militia, protect civilians and facilitate delivery of humanitarian assistance in Darfur. The Sudanese Government has thus far rejected such a force. The U.S. should lead the United Nations to impose tough sanctions now. The Government of Sudan must understand that the world will act, if they do not, and that the United States is prepared to support the African Union with crucial capabilities of our own, if necessary, to halt the genocide.\nSo, we've got work to do. We have to march. We have to do the hard work of changing people's minds. We have to expand opportunity and close the gaps of inequality that impede the progress of our nation. Together, we can stop being what W.E.B. DuBois called, \"a nation within a nation.\" Our job, between now and November is to end the division between the fortunate America and the forgotten America. We must come to together to build one America – because we know as Dr. King told us, that what's good for black America is good for all America.\nAs I said before, this is the most important election of our lifetime. If you believe that this country is heading in the right direction, you should keep them in office. But if you believe, like I think you do, that we can't afford for more years of the wrong choices and the wrong direction, then join with us for an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.\nAnd let me say this: The black vote is going to be critical this year. We can't afford to sit this one out or leave it up to our neighbor – and we won't. We can't afford to take any vote for granted – and we won't. We can't afford four more years. My friends, I need your vote. And I need your help. And I'm asking for it now.\nWe have 52 days left until the election. The clock is ticking. Together, we can make the right choices. We can come together. We can fulfill the promise of a better America. There are those who want to divide us into red states and blue states. Not me. I want to unite us as one America – red, white and blue.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2004-09-11", "title": "Remarks to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's 34th Annual Legislative Conference in Washington, DC"}

Lost jobs, health care costs through the roof, the surplus gone, our alliances shredded, and our influence challenged. And then the other day, we were driving along the road in our campaign bus, and I saw a sign with a lone \"W\" leaning up against a post. At first, I was a little confused. But then, it all made sense.\nAs the President likes George W. Bush. And the W stands for wrong. Wrong choices, wrong direction, and wrong leadership for America. And this election all comes down to one decision: Do we want four more years of wrong choices, or do we want to move America in a new direction?\nThe choice in this election couldn't be more clear. Do we want four more years of lost jobs and falling wages ... four more years of rising health care costs ... four more years of raiding Social Security to give tax cuts to the wealthy ... four more years of schools being shortchanged, leaving millions of children behind ... four more years of shipping jobs overseas and replacing them with jobs that pay you less ... four more years of a go-it-alone foreign policy. If you do, then you should vote for George W. Bush.\nBut if you want health care for all Americans ... if you want schools that work ... if you want jobs that pay more ... if you want Social Security that's there for the future .... then we need to move America in a new direction with John Edwards and me. And that's the choice in this election.\nOf all George Bush's wrong choices, the most catastrophic choice is the mess he's made in Iraq. It's not that I would have done one thing differently in Iraq, I would have done almost everything differently. It was wrong to rush to war without a plan to win the peace. It was wrong not to build a strong international coalition of our allies. And it was wrong to put our young men and women into harm's way without a clear mission and the support to get it done.\nIt was wrong for America to go it alone. And now every American is paying the price. Almost all the casualties are the sons and daughters of America. And nearly 90 percent of the cost is coming out of your pocket. The price-tag so far: $200 billion and rising every day. That's $200 billion we're not investing in health care and education. That's $200 billion we're not investing to make sure no child is left behind. That's $200 billion we're not investing in new and better jobs. That's $200 billion we're not investing in homeland security, to protect our airports, our subways, our bridges and tunnels. That's W. Wrong choices, wrong direction, and wrong leadership for America.\nWhen it comes to our economy, George W. Bush has made the wrong choices again and again. Over the last three years, we've lost 2.7 million manufacturing jobs here in America. In fact, George Bush is the first president in 72 years -- since the Great Depression -- to actually lose jobs.\nAt that convention last week, the Bush administration said that outsourcing jobs is good for America. That's what they've done for four years and they want to do it for another four. That's W. Wrong choices, wrong direction, wrong leadership for America.\nWe're going to set a new direction for America – we're going to close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas, and we're going to reward companies that create and keep good paying jobs here in America.\nAnd let me tell you, when it comes to our nation's senior citizens, George W. Bush has made all the wrong choices. The result is that the members of our greatest generation are still making the greatest sacrifices.\nOn everything from prescription drugs to retirement security to Medicare and Social Security, George W. Bush has made the wrong choices and seniors are paying the price. He's driving them right out of the middle class. So seniors are getting squeezed like never before – but for big drug companies, these truly are the golden years.\nJust look at George Bush's Medicare drug plan. That plan gives drug companies a $139 billion payoff – instead of making drugs more affordable. That's wrong. It's wrong for him to force seniors into HMO's and to let drug companies set higher prices – instead of trying to get a better deal for our seniors. And it's wrong for him to stop seniors from getting the drugs they need – instead of letting them buy safe, FDA-approved drugs from Canada.\nThat's W. Wrong choices, wrong direction, wrong leadership for America.\nOnce again, this Administration has not been honest with the American people. Today, we found out that they are hiding the truth about your Social Security and Medicare prescription drug benefit. Each year, the Bush Administration has reported to you on how much of your Social Security benefit is eaten up by your Medicare costs. This year, they left that crucial bit of information out.\nWhy? Because they don't want you to know the truth: the Bush Administration has let costs get so high, that you're using more and more of your Social Security to pay for Medicare. Prescription drug costs are way up. Medicare costs are way up. And George Bush hasn't done a thing to stop it. But this shouldn't come as a surprise to any of us.\nThe same Medicare officials who tried to hide the real cost of the failed prescription drug plan are now hiding the skyrocketing costs to you for your health care. That's W. Wrong choices, wrong direction, wrong leadership for America.\nAnd with health care costs pushing seniors to the brink, George W. Bush has done nothing to help. Recently, at that convention in New York, the President said he finally had a plan to get costs under control. Now we know what he had in mind. The very next day the Bush administration announced that Medicare premiums will go up 17 percent next year alone – the biggest increase in Medicare premiums in the history of the program. And on George Bush's watch, Medicare premiums have gone up 56 percent.\nTo make matters worse, many seniors are finding that their Social Security checks aren't even getting them through the month. Health care costs are so high, they're cutting right into the cost of living adjustment you get from Social Security. But George W. Bush doesn't just want to eat away at your Social Security paycheck – he wants to privatize the whole program and cut your benefits. When it comes to our seniors, George Bush has a simple four-word answer: slash Social Security first.\nThat's W and that's wrong – wrong choices, wrong direction, wrong leadership for America.\nJohn Edwards and I will set a new direction. We'll strengthen Social Security to give you the financial security you've earned. When it comes to health care and Medicare, we're going to put you first. Medicare doesn't belong to the special interests, it belongs to you. You paid for it.\nAnd John Edwards and I have a plan for a real prescription drug benefit for seniors and to cut the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. We'll make health care more affordable by cutting the waste and greed out of our health care system, by saving the average family up to $1,000 a year on their premiums, and by letting seniors buy safe and affordable drugs from Canada. We believe that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected – it's a right for all Americans.\nSo this election comes down to a fundamental choice: if you believe that this country is heading in the right direction, you should support George Bush. But if you believe a vote for W is a vote for wrong choices and the wrong direction, then join with us. If you believe we need good jobs, health care for all, energy independence, and a new direction in Iraq, then I ask you to stand with us.\nWe have 49 days until the election. The clock is ticking. This is the most important election of our lifetime. Everything is one the line: our jobs, our health care, the character of our country. But you can make the difference. Together, we can make better choices for this country. We can lift this country up. We can bring this country back together.\nWe can do this. We're the can do people. Our best days are still ahead of us. There are those who want to divide America into red states and blue states. Not me. I want to unite us as one America – red, white and blue. With your help, we will take this country in a new direction.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2004-09-14", "title": "Remarks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29729", "text": "Thank you. It's great to be back at the Detroit Economic Club. I guess you could say that since I came here last September, I've had a pretty eventful year. My Patriots won another Superbowl, my Red Sox almost won the Pennant, and my Celtics...well, my Celtics made sure they didn't get in the way of a Piston's championship.\nDuring that year, John Edwards and I have made our way across this country we love. And at every stop in our journey, we have witnessed the American spirit and listened to the American story.\nI can tell you that the American spirit is strong. While millions are struggling to find work, and millions more are struggling to pay the bills, the folks I've met hold on to an optimism that's both courageous and classically American. They know we can do better. They know our best days lie ahead. And they still believe that America can be a land of opportunity for every American.\nBut I can also tell you that for too many of these families, the past four years of their American story has been a chapter they'd soon like to forget. I met one of these families just last week. I was talking with some folks in Cannonsburg, Pennsylvania about lost jobs, falling wages, and rising health care costs when a woman in the back of the crowd slowly stood up, looked me in the eyes, and said, \"You just told our story.\"\nLori Sheldon and her husband work two jobs to get by. She's at an insurance company, and he's on the ground crew of an airline in Pittsburgh. After years of work, they are about to lose their health coverage. In a few months, Mr. Sheldon may lose his job. This story was hard for Lori to tell, but what she had the courage to say next will stay with me always. With tears in her eyes, she asked, \"You see those two young ladies over there? Those are my daughters. I'm tired of saying no to them. We say no all the time.\"\nThat's what this election is really about. I want an America where Lori Sheldon and parents like her can start saying yes to her children. An America where people are optimistic about their future, and believe, as we always have, that next generation will do better than that the last. That's what this country has always been built on.\nAnd after four years of hearing no from this President – no, it's not our fault; no, there's nothing wrong; no, we can't do better; no, we haven't made a single mistake – it's time for a president who will start saying yes. Yes to good jobs with higher wages; yes to affordable health care and middle-class tax cuts; yes to a government that lives within a budget and businesses that can out-compete anyone in the world.\nToday, I'm here to tell you we can do this with an economic plan based on a simple principle: a stronger America means a growing middle-class where every American has the chance to work and the opportunity to get ahead.\nAnd let me be clear: our plan is pro-worker and pro-business. I'm an entrepreneurial Democrat, and I don't believe you can love jobs but bash the people who create them. I chaired the Small Business Committee for years and I started my own small business. I know that the private sector will always be the engine of good jobs and new ideas. And I also know that the right economic policy can create the conditions for new businesses to grow and succeed. It can also help more businesses say \"yes\" to investing more in America and \"yes\" to lifting up middle-class families with good jobs that pay good wages.\nThe middle class is the moral and economic backbone of this nation. But for four years, the Bush Administration hasn't honored that truth, and it certainly hasn't lived up to it.\nGeorge Bush's record speaks for itself. 1.6 million lost jobs. The first president in 72 years to actually lose jobs on his watch. 8 million Americans are now looking for work. 45 million have no health insurance – 5 million more than the day he took office. 4.3 million Americans have slipped into poverty over the last four years – 1.3 million are children. The average family saw their income fall $1,500, while they saw the cost of health care, child care, gasoline, and tuition rise faster than ever before. 220,000 more Americans did not attend college last year for the simple reason that they could not afford it. This President turned a $5.6 trillion surplus into trillions of debt for our children. George Bush accomplished all this in only four years. Imagine what he could do in another four. I want to be clear: I'm not saying that president wanted these consequences. But I am saying that by his judgments, by his priorities, he has caused these things to happen. And he can't see the error of his ways.\nAt that convention in New York the other week, President Bush talked about his ownership society. Well Mr. President, when it comes to your record, we agree – you own it.\nOf course, the President would have us believe that his record is the result of bad luck, not bad decisions. That he's faced the wrong circumstances, not made the wrong choices. In fact, this President has created more excuses than jobs. His is the Excuse Presidency: Never wrong, Never Responsible, Never to Blame. President Bush's desk isn't where the buck stops – it's where the blame begins. He's blamed just about everyone but himself and his administration for America's economic problems. And if he's missed you, don't worry – he's still got 48 days left until the election.\nHe sure has a lot of excuses, but you know what? Of the last eleven presidents – many who faced war and recession – George Bush is the only one to actually lose jobs on his watch.\nWe know the truth. George Bush's failed record is the result of George Bush's failed policies. And he chose time and again to do nothing to improve our economy or ease the burden on middle class families. In fact, nearly every choice has made it worse. You can even say that George Bush is proud of the fact that not even failure can cause him to change his mind. This is the man who promised his tax cuts would create 6 million new jobs. Today, three tax cuts later, we've lost a million -- seven million jobs short of his prediction. To George Bush, stubborn leadership is steady leadership. But as far as I'm concerned, George Bush's failures are the result of misplaced values and wrong choices that always give more and more to those with the most and tells the middle-class \"you are not the priority.\"\nPresident Bush inherited record employment, record homeownership, record surpluses; an America of higher incomes, less poverty, and more families with health care.\nAnd when the economy faced some rough waters, and we could have put tax cuts into the pockets of families most likely to need the money and spend it, George Bush chose massive tax giveaways for the wealthiest individuals that blew the surplus and did next to nothing to get our economy moving. If anything helped ease the recession, it was the strong income growth of the 90s and historic rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, not George Bush's unaffordable tax cuts. They were the wrong choices, and middle-class families paid the price.\nWhen Republican and Democratic governors all across the country were asking Washington for help so that they didn't have to raise tuition, raise local taxes, take cops off the street, and shut down our schools, George Bush chose more deficits and more tax giveaways to the wealthy instead. That was the wrong choice, and middle-class families paid the price.\nWhen George Bush saw job after job being shipped overseas, he chose to sit back and protect the tax cuts that rewarded companies who were doing so.\nWhen China and Japan were manipulating their currency and violating our trade agreements, and he saw America lose 2.7 million manufacturing jobs, George Bush chose to say and do nothing for workers in Michigan and Ohio and all over the country.\nWhen he saw the cost of energy rising, he chose secret meetings the oil industry and special friendships with the Saudis over an energy independent America.\nAnd when he saw millions lose their health care and millions more struggling with record premiums, he chose a $139 billion giveaway to the drug companies instead.\nHe chose and he chose and he chose and every single time it was middle-class Americans who paid the price.\nIf you like that choice, then you're in luck, because George Bush and Dick Cheney are promising four more years of the same. Four more years of the same choices from an administration that says we should celebrate an economy of job loss, says that incentives for outsourcing is good for America, and even tells us that this is the best economy of our lifetime.\nJohn Edwards and I believe that the measure of a strong economy is a growing middle-class where everyone has the chance to work hard and get ahead. And that's why we are determined to set a new direction for America.\nOur opponents see an America where power and wealth stay in the hands of a few at the top, while everyone else is left to fend for themselves. We believe in an America where we widen the circle of opportunity for every American. An America where anyone with a good idea who's willing to work hard and take a risk can start a business and build success.\nOur opponents see an America where more of the tax burden is paid by those who work the hardest and not those who have the most – where a fireman who works overtime to save lives pays higher tax rates than a billionaire who just inherited a fortune. We believe in an America that rewards work with lower taxes and higher incomes.\nOur opponents see an America where the powerful and well-connected are the first priority. We believe in an America where the first priority is the great middle-class and those struggling to join it – to be able to save money, create wealth, create the businesses of tomorrow. We want all Americans to have the chance to be millionaires and billionaires.\nThese are our values and these are the principles of our economic plan for a stronger America. It's a plan that creates good jobs here in America; a plan that gives relief to middle-class families struggling to pay the bills; and a plan that puts our fiscal house in order and makes our economy more competitive so that we can invest in the high-wage, middle-class jobs of tomorrow.\nFirst, we will create good-paying, middle-class jobs right here in America. Today, if a company is torn between creating jobs in Michigan or Malaysia, we now have a tax code that encourages you to go overseas. George Bush thinks that's right. I believe it's wrong. And as President, I will end it.\nI will close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas. Instead, we're going to use that revenue to reward companies that create and keep good jobs here in the United States of America. Under my plan, we'll cut the corporate tax rate by five percent, giving 99 percent of businesses a tax break.\nWe value an America that exports products, not jobs – and we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own job.\nTo the small businesses and manufacturers who decide to add more employees to the payroll, we will provide a New Jobs Tax Credit for every person you hire. And to those small business owners who want to hire more employees but cannot afford to insure them, we will give you up to a 50% tax cut on your health care contributions when you cover your workers.\nAnd finally, we will show that a smart trade policy can both open markets and stand up for American workers. We will never succeed in the global economy if we don't open markets and compete in the world. But we'll never get ahead if other countries aren't living up to their part of the bargain. This Administration hasn't enforced our trade deals – I will, because if you give the American worker a fair playing field to compete on, there's nobody in the world the American worker can't compete against.\nSecond, we will make sure that we reward the hard work of our middle-class families by cutting their taxes and lowering their health care costs -- so they can raise the quality of their lives and get our economy moving.\nSo to help them cover the rising costs of child care, we'll offer a tax credit of $1,000. To give more young Americans the chance to go to college, we'll offer a tax break on up to $4,000 in tuition for four years of college. And to help middle-class families pay for health care, we'll offer a health plan that will lower premiums up to $1,000 a year.\nSpiraling health care costs have been enemy number one for job creation in the United States. They've made our manufacturing sector less competitive and made it that much harder for small businesses to succeed. When the health care costs are so high – up 50 percent in the last four years -- too many businesses have simply decided they can't afford to hire full-time workers with good benefits.\nMy health care plan gets the waste and the greed out of the system to bring down the cost of health care and make your businesses more competitive. We're going to make you the following deal: if you have a health wellness program, we'll pay for 75 percent of your catastrophic costs. We'll improve technology in the system to bring down premiums. And we'll let you buy into the same health care program that senators and congressmen can.\nUnder our plan, you will get to pick you own doctors – and doctors and patients, not insurance company bureaucrats will make medical decisions. My plan is not a government plan. It's based on incentives and the marketplace.\nTo pay for all this, we make sure that 98 percent of all Americans get a tax cut, while rolling back only the tax cuts for those who make more than $200,000 a year. Those Americans will go back to paying the same taxes you paid when Bill Clinton was president. And the rest of America will get a tax cut.\nThird, we'll restore America's competitive edge to lift up our economy and invest in the middle-class jobs of tomorrow.\nNever has American competitiveness fallen so far and so fast as it has under George W. Bush. We have a $500 billion trade deficit, and we're borrowing money from the same countries we're competing with for good jobs. Our plan stands up for American companies and American workers by lowering the cost of doing business.\nBut if we want America to thrive in the long run, we must invest more in our people and their ideas so that we can create high-tech, high-wage jobs in industries that are already improving the quality of our lives. We will push the boundaries of science, and never let ideology get in the way of life-saving research or cutting-edge technology. We will offer tax credits to help us seize the possibilities of the Broadband Revolution and make Internet access available to all of America's families. And we will offer tax credits to buy and produce the fuel-efficient cars of the future.\nHere in Detroit, you know what we're talking about. We have the opportunity to build these cars right here. And for our energy future, I'd rather depend on your innovation and the ingenuity of America's workers than on the Saudi Royal family. So when I am President, you will have a partner and a champion in your fight to create the cutting-edge manufacturing jobs of the future.\nAnd we will give our workers the education and the job training that the jobs of tomorrow require today. We'll encourage more young women and minorities to enter the fields of math and science so we can close that gap and compete with the rest of the world. And we'll make lifelong learning a reality so that workers can learn new skills for the new jobs of tomorrow.\nFinally, our plan is paid for while cutting the deficit in half, because we believe it's time for Washington to live within a budget just like you do.\nFour years ago, America's fiscal discipline was the envy of the world. Today, we have to go hat in hand to countries like China and Japan to borrow money because George Bush chose to pass and propose trillions of dollars in spending without paying for a dime of it. Now, his election year promises will add $3 trillion to the already record-breaking deficits he created on his watch. $3 trillion of taxpayer money. This president has added more to the deficit than every president from George Washington to Ronald Reagan combined.\nWhen you are running the type of massive deficits that they are, Bob Rubin and other experts will tell you that you are jeopardizing job creation and putting the stability of our economic future at risk.\nOur plan will cut the deficit in half in four years by ending tax giveaways that are nothing more than corporate welfare. We will make government go back to a simple rule: pay as you go. We will cut the waste from our government – cutting 100,000 contractors we don't need, cutting more bureaucrats that have been added over the last four years, and cutting government agencies that have outlived their purposes. And we will impose caps so that spending doesn't go faster than inflation.\nI will hold my own priorities to the same standard, because I have always believed that fiscal discipline leads to a strong economic future. That's why when I first came to the Senate, I broke with my own party to support a balanced budget plan, which President Ronald Reagan signed into law.\nSince this campaign began, so many Americans have come up to me and said, this is the most important election of our lifetime. If there were ever any doubt that this is true, you only need to look around our country and see for yourself what the last four years have done to middle-class America.\nRight now, another factory worker just suffered the indignity of having lifelong loyalty rewarded with a pink slip and a final paycheck that won't cover his family's rent. Right now, another young woman is watching her friends begin the college year without her because she couldn't afford to go. Right now, another boarded-up business is leaving for China, and leaving a community of devastated families behind. And right now, Lori Sheldon is wondering when she'll be able to start saying yes to her daughters.\nEveryone in this room and everyone in this country has an interest in building that kind of America. As Henry Ford understood, those who run companies can't prosper unless we raise the incomes and the standard of living for the great middle-class.\nWe can do this. We can have an America where that factory worker goes back to school and will learn the new skills to build the cars of the future right here in Detroit. We can have an America where that young woman's family can afford to send her to college, keep their health care, and have a little left over at the end of the month. We can have an America where big ideas and bold entrepreneurs fill that community with new jobs and new hope for better days ahead.\nThat's what America was built on – from Ford Motors and the first Model T to IBM and the first computer. We are a country of innovators and optimists. There are possibilities waiting for us and ideas yet to be imagined -- but only if we make the right choices today. This is our challenge. And it's what this race is all about.\nThank you, God Bless you, and God Bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-09-15", "title": "Remarks at the Detroit Economic Club"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29730", "text": "Thank you, Congressman Rodriguez for that generous introduction and thanks to the members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for your powerful voice in the Congress. All of us here salute those of you who are beginning a bus tour tomorrow to carry the message of our campaign to Hispanic voters all across America.\nI also want to acknowledge Congressman Bob Menendez, Chair of the Democratic Caucus; Congressman Ed Pastor, a DNC co-chair and one of our earliest supporters; and Ingrid Duran, executive director of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute.\nI want to add my congratulations to the two awardees tonight – Dolores Huerta and Arturo Rodriguez. I'm sure you would agree that the best way we could honor their service is to finish the job and pass the AgJobs bill that has met such strong resistance by this administration. It is clear that President Bush will do everything he can to stop this legislation. As president, I will do everything I can to pass it. With your continued support, the strong support of the CHC and my fellow co-sponsors in the Senate, I am confident the AgJobs bill will become the law of the land and I intend to be the President who signs it into law.\nBefore I begin, Teresa and I want to extend our prayers to the people in the southeastern United States who have lost love ones, lost their homes and whose lives have been uprooted by the series of storms that have struck that region in recent weeks. Our government and our citizens should do all we can to assist the victims. Many of our Caribbean neighbors were also devastated by Ivan and the other storms. As Americans, we should extend not only our thoughts and prayers but also a helping hand as they begin rebuilding their homes and their lives.\nForty years ago, with the passage of the Civil Rights Act, our nation had a great moment of conscience. And while President Lyndon Johnson's signature inscribed that bill on our statute books, we know it was really written by millions of everyday foot soldiers for justice who were willing to stand up and speak out – risk their lives and put it all on the line for justice.\nCesar Chavez was one of those foot soldiers. He set an example – he inspired so many of us. And he brought America to another great moment of conscience when in 1968 he fasted for 25 days to promote equal opportunity for the farm workers in California's San Joaquin Valley and beyond. When he ended that strike by going to Mass and breaking bread with Robert Kennedy, he reminded us that while we may differ, in the end we are a \"family bound together in a common struggle for justice.\"\nThat's what this struggle is really about. It is why we are here tonight. It is what the CHC and the CHCI are all about. And it is why I am running for president.\nMy friends, Cesar's dream – our dream – is dim and denied in the Washington of today. To put it bluntly: it is time for us to stand up to the powerful interests and fight for a new moment of conscience in America.\nThis is, quite simply, the most important election of our lifetime. Everything is on the line: our jobs, our health care, our role in the world, the character of our country – the Supreme Court of the United States. The stakes are high and the choices are clear.\nOn issue after issue, the other side has been trying to muddy the waters to keep voters from seeing the real differences and the real choices in this election. They have engaged in the most negative campaign in history – spending millions to distort my record, for one simple reason: On every issue -- from Iraq to Social Security, from fiscal discipline to education, from jobs and wages to worker rights, and immigration -- they don't have a record to run on; they have a record to run away from.\nAnd John Edwards and I are going to fight every day to show the difference between the tired, old, negative politics of the past and a new direction for America.\nNobody understands the great differences in this election more than the members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. You live with the wrong choices of the Bush Administration every day and you see the impact they're having on our families and communities. And in this room are some of the best ideas to make our nation stronger. But over the last four years, down the street at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, they've shut their doors and shut you out of the debate.\nI'm running for president because it's time to open the doors to the People's House and let all Americans back in. Because we deserve a president who doesn't just meet with those he agrees with. We deserve a president who's not afraid to sit down with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the National Council of La Raza, the NAACP, and the Black Caucus. And despite the photo opportunities, expensive brochures, and contrived overtures – no community has seen more promises broken than this administration: immigration reform, no child left behind, affirmative action, small business lending, bilingual education, jobs. My friends: we deserve a president who doesn't just talk the talk. We deserve a President who walks the walk and speaks to the every day needs of the Hispanic community.\nI've been privileged to be your partner on the legislative battlefield for a long time now. In my 20 years in the Senate, I have been proud to stand with the CHC on every issue that matters. And the CHCI has been a champion in the effort to expand college opportunity and prepare the leaders of tomorrow.\nWe need to join together now as never before. The fact is, the wrong choices of the Bush administration – reduced taxes for the few and reduced opportunities for the middle class and those struggling to join it – are taking us back to two Americas -- separate and unequal. Our cities and communities are being torn apart by divisive and destructive forces: crumbling schools robbing our children of their potential...rising poverty...rising crime, drugs and violence. Lost jobs, health care costs through the roof, the surplus gone, our alliances shredded, our influence challenged.\nThey see what we see but their answer is to say we've turned the corner or that the job is getting done or that this is the best that we can do. They've even mocked the very notion that there are two Americas. Well, they should spend time with struggling families in the colonias by the Texas border...in the hills of Appalachia ... or in public housing in Detroit and then tell us our journey to build one America is finished.\nFor four years, we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values are not just words. They're what we live by – faith and family; the ability to work and send your kids to college; responsibility from all; opportunity for all; and the most important value of all – that we are all created in the image and likeness of God. I first learned these values at home from a strong, caring mother who taught me the importance of service to God, family and community.\nThose are the values that bring us together as one America. So, this election all comes down to one decision: Do we want four more years of the wrong values and the wrong choices for our country, or do we want to move America in a new direction?\nOf all the president's wrong choices, the most catastrophic one is the mess he's made in Iraq. It's not that I would have done one thing differently in Iraq, I would've done almost everything differently. It was wrong to rush to war without a plan to win the peace. It was wrong not to build a strong international coalition of our allies.\nAnd because we went it alone, we are bearing the burden and paying almost all the cost by ourselves. Almost all the casualties are the sons and daughters of America. And 90 percent of the costs are being met by Americans – the total so far: $200 billion and rising every day. That's $200 billion we're not investing in health care and education That's $200 billion we're not investing to make sure no child is left behind. That's $200 billion we're not investing in incentives to create and keep good jobs in the United States of America. That's $200 billion we're not investing in homeland security to keep cops on the street, to protect our airports, our subways, our bridges and tunnels. That's unacceptable -- and that's why 47 days from now we're going to move this country in a new direction.\nIn the last three years, America has lost 1.6 million jobs. Eight million Americans are out of work. Hispanic unemployment is close to seven percent and 351,000 more Hispanics are out of work since George Bush took office.\nMy friends, the promise of a better America is not being met when in the last year alone, a million more people have fallen into poverty...when nine million Hispanics, including 30 percent of Hispanic children are living in poverty. Is that compassionate? Is that right? Well, 47 days from now we're going to move America in a new direction.\nIt has been said before, but it is so true: The best anti-poverty program is a job. That is why, as President, I will set a new direction. We're going to close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas. Instead, we're going to use common sense and reward companies that create and keep good jobs here in America. And we are going to do more to bring hope and jobs and businesses back to our hardest-pressed urban and metropolitan areas.\nAnd, can you believe it -- at that convention in New York, this president actually promised the American people that after four years of failure, he now had a plan to get health care costs under control. Well, if you weren't suspicious enough of a plan announced two months before an election, we only had to wait twenty-four hours to find out what he meant. The day after he spoke, he raised Medicare premiums by 17 percent -- the biggest increase in Medicare premiums in the history of the program.\nUnder the Bush Administration, 5 million Americans have lost their health insurance, including almost a million and a half Hispanics. Forty-five million Americans have no coverage at all. As we know, minorities are far more likely to have poorer health and less access to affordable health care. And what's this administration's answer? At a time when the need is greatest, they have cut funding for Medicaid and children's health insurance. Instead of working to close disparities, they have closed the Office of Minority Health at CDC. That's the wrong choice and the wrong direction for America.\nBy the choices he has made, the President has proven that when it comes to health care, the big drug companies come first, the insurance companies come second, and the American people come last. That's the wrong choice and the wrong direction for America.\nAs President, I will set a new direction. I'm going to put hard working families first. Our plan will take on the waste and greed in the health care system and save the average family up to $1,000 a year on their premiums. Our plan will cover all children – automatically – from day one. Go to school, you're covered. Go to day care, you're enrolled. Every child in America will be covered.\nAnd we're going to face up to, not run away from the crisis in minority health. We can't claim to value equality and then accept ever-widening disparities in health and health care that continue to break down along ethnic lines. We cannot call ourselves \"One nation under God\" until all our people are able to share equally the benefits of the best health care system in the world.\nWhen I am president, America will stop being the only advanced nation on earth which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected, it is a right for all Americans.\nAnd, at that convention in New York, this president, incredibly, talked about demanding accountability from everybody in education -- except his own administration. We know that you can't really get the job done in our classrooms when too many children, especially minority children, are forced to attend overcrowded and crumbling schools and are being taught by overworked and underpaid teachers. The promise of a better America is not being met when nearly 50 percent of Hispanics do not finish high school and only 11 percent are expected to finish college.\nAnd, Mr. President, if you say you value education and want to leave no child behind, then why are you freezing Pell grants, cutting student loans, abandoning efforts to help more low income students go to college and why won't you support the Dream Act?\nI will support the Dream Act, because the Dream Act offers a simple deal that keeps faith with American common sense: any child who is brought here, who works hard in school, stays out of trouble and earns the chance to go to college – should have that chance. They say that's wrong. Well, I say that's right. And that is why they are the wrong choice, the wrong direction and the wrong leadership for America.\nAs President, I will set a new direction. We know the answer to closing the achievement gap is both higher expectations and greater resources. You can't promise to leave no child behind and then leave the money behind. John Edwards and I have a plan to invest in our future, provide the needed funding and put a good teacher in every classroom – so that all our children will have the chance to develop their God-given potential. And the chance to go to college.\nFinally, like Franklin Roosevelt, I understand that a strong Latin America is key to a strong America. But, this administration has neglected our relationship with our southern neighbors. As president, I will build a new \"Community of the Americas,\" where neighbors work together toward shared goals.\nSo, we've got work to do. We have to march. We have to do the hard work of changing people's minds. We have to expand opportunity and close the gaps of inequality that impede the progress of our nation. Our job, between now and November is to end the division between the fortunate America and the forgotten America. We must come to together to build one America.\nAs Cesar Chavez reminded us, \"We cannot seek achievement for ourselves and forget about progress and prosperity for our community...Our ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of others, for their sakes and for our own.\"\nComo he dicho antes, esta es la elecciуn mбs importante de nuestras vidas. Todo lo que es importante para nuestras familias estб en riesgo. Empleos. Cuidado de salud. Nuestros hijos. Disciplina fiscal . Igualdad de oportunidades. El papel de los Estados Unidos en el mundo. Nuestro futuro. Si ustedes creen que este paнs va en la direcciуn equivocada, entonces mantйnganlo en la Casa Blanca. Pero si creen, como yo, que no podemos aguantar cuatro aсos mбs de decisiones equivocadas y de ir en la direcciуn equivocada, entonces ъnanse a nosotros por un paнs mбs fuerte en casa y respetado en el mundo.\nAs I said before, this is the most important election of our lifetime. Everything we care about is on the line. Jobs. Health care. Our children. Fiscal discipline. Equal opportunity. America's role in the world. Our future. If you believe that this country is heading in the right direction, you should keep them in office. But if you believe, as I do, that we can't afford for more years of the wrong choices and the wrong direction, then join with us for an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.\nAnd let me say this: The Hispanic vote is critical this year. We can't afford to sit this one out or leave it up to our neighbor – and we won't. We can't afford to take any vote for granted – and we won't. We can't afford four more years. Mis amigos, necesito su voto. Necesito su ayuda. Eso les pido ahora. My friends, I need your vote. And I need your help. And I'm asking for it now.\nTogether, we can fulfill the promise of a better America. There are those who want to divide us into red states and blue states. Not me. I want to unite us as one America – red, white and blue.\nThank you, God bless you, y que Dios bendiga a los Estados Unidos de America.", "timestamp": "2004-09-15", "title": "Remarks at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 27th Annual Gala in Washington, DC"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29731", "text": "I'm honored to be here today at your 126th Convention. I can't tell you how proud I am to stand before you – and how grateful I am to have the opportunity to talk with you today.\nI came out here because I wanted to look you in the eye and say thank you. Thank you for your service; thank you for caring; thank you for the sacrifices you and your families make for our country.\nI come from a state with a great tradition of service and a great understanding of who you are. You can't live in the shadow of Bunker Hill, Lexington Green, the Bridge at Concord, and not know the meaning of Minutemen and citizen service to country.\nFor more than three centuries, as you know better than anyone, our National Guard has stood on the frontlines of freedom. The Guard fought in that first great revolution, and has defended our country ever since, here in America and around the world. Like those who came before you, you joined the Guard because for you, threats to our ideals were a call to action. You joined because for you, sitting on the sidelines in a time of peril simply wasn't an option. And you joined because for you, patriotism isn't just about saying you love your country – it's about living it every single day. Please join me in sending our respect, our admiration, and the thanks of a nation to your brothers and sisters in arms who are standing up for freedom around the world.\nThere's something going on right here at home, too. Every time you open the newspaper or turn on the evening news, you read those heartbreaking stories about floods, and fires, and hurricanes – when you see the indelible images of September 11th –the National Guard is there, often risking your lives to save ours. In the past few weeks, thousands of you have been in the eye of the storm, preparing for Hurricane Charlie, Hurricane Frances, and Hurricane Ivan – and afterwards, helping our citizens rebuild their lives. Behind the headlines, through countless acts of courage, honor and quiet sacrifice, all of you keep America safe – reporting for duty on a moment's notice: \"Ready, Reliable, Essential and Accessible.\" Nothing could make us more proud.\nThe reach of today's Guard is unlike anytime before. In Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Balkans, you have been mobilized in record numbers for extended lengths of time. Gone are the days when you could tell your family that it would be just 6 months, just 9 months, just a year. Today, we've got people doing multiple deployments – serving 18, 20, even 22 months. We've got young kids here at home sending letters to their parents asking: When are you coming home? When will I see you again? And week after week, those mothers and fathers can only write back the same frustrating answer: I just don't know.\nLast week, we reached a tragic milestone in Iraq: More than 1,000 American servicemen and women have been killed in the line of duty – and more than 100 of them were members of the National Guard. Thousands more have been injured – many of them seriously so. I have visited with some of them in our military hospitals – and let me tell you, I cannot overstate their patriotism, their courageous spirit, and their commitment to our country and to their brothers and sisters still in harm's way. We honor every last one of them for their proud service to our nation, and we pray for their families and loved ones.\nBut honoring your service with our thoughts and prayers is not enough. Especially when right now, in so many ways, we're shortchanging our men and women in the Guard.\nThose in uniform are duty bound to carry out the orders of the Commander in Chief. And I know that for those of you serving there is a natural affection and a sense of duty. I respect that and it should be that way. But in our democracy, which you defend, it is so important to have a truthful conversation about the choices we face in our nation.\nRight now, more than 20% of our National Guard and Reserves don't have health coverage. And two days ago, our President came before you, and promised that he'd give you TRICARE for \"up to 90 days before [you] report, and 180 days after de-activation.\" That's a welcome change in their policy, but frankly, I believe that's simply not good enough. I believe we can make better choices. When you sign up for the Guard, you should be eligible for TRICARE every day that you serve – before, during, and after mobilization – end of story.\nRight now, thousands in the Guard still aren't getting their paychecks on time -- and some don't get them at all. So people are calling home from the frontlines, and instead of talking about how the kids are doing in school, they're talking about how to cut through the red tape, and how to pay the bills. That's wrong, and we have to change it.\nRight now, too many in the Guard still don't have the body armor, night vision goggles, and radios they need to do their jobs. Too many are using outdated equipment and hand-me-downs from regular forces – and they're wondering if today will be the unlucky day when something just doesn't work. That's wrong, and we have to change it.\nRight now, those who serve in the Guard can't receive retirement benefits until age 60, and this Administration can't find the funding to lower the age to 55, even while we're spending $200 billion to go it alone in Iraq. That's wrong, and for those who've served in active duty in conflicts aboard, we have to change it.\nRight now, members of the Guard serving overseas are losing their paychecks here at home, passed over for promotions, and returning to find that the jobs they once held are gone. That's wrong, and we have to change it.\nRight now, our troops over-stretched and over-extended and the Guard and Reserve have been called on to fill the gap. As President, I pledge to you that I will end the backdoor draft of our National Guard.\nSo today, respectfully, I'd like to ask President Bush a simple question. When our Guardsmen and women are fighting the same war as our active duty troops...when they're facing the same dangers, and coming home in the same wheelchairs, stretchers, and flag-draped coffins...how can we refuse to give them the same resources and respect we give our Regular troops? I believe we can make better choices.\nThe way I see it, this is a matter of values and priorities – and on these issues, President Bush and I couldn't be more different. I believe that America's security begins and ends with our men and women in uniform – with every member of our armed forces who stands guard at the gates of freedom. I will be a President who goes into the Oval Office every morning knowing that it is my job to help you do yours. I will fight for you every day, and I will never let you down. General Clark and I were talking on the way out here about the quality of our armed forces. You are America's finest, the most capable, the most skilled troops in our history, led by the best military leaders in the world. And you deserve no less than the best.\nAnd there's something else we owe you and all the men and women serving right now in Iraq. We owe you the truth. True leadership is about looking people in the eye and telling the truth – even when it's hard to hear. And two days ago, President Bush came before you and you received him well, as you should. But I believe he failed the fundamental test of leadership. He failed to tell you the truth. You deserve better. The Commander in Chief must level with the troops and the nation. And as president, I will always be straight with you – on the good days, and the bad days.\nTwo days ago, the President stood right where I'm standing and did not even acknowledge that more than 1,000 men and women have lost their lives in Iraq. He did not tell you that with each passing day, we're seeing more chaos, more violence, more indiscriminate killings. He did not tell you that with each passing week, our enemies are getting bolder – that Pentagon officials report that entire regions of Iraq are now in the hands of terrorists and extremists. He did not tell you that with each passing month, stability and security seem farther and farther away.\nHe did not tell you any of this, even though – as the country learned today in the New York Times – his own intelligence officials have warned him for weeks that the mission in Iraq is in serious trouble. But that is the truth – hard as it is to hear. You deserve a president who will not play politics with national security, who will not ignore his own intelligence, while living in a fantasy world of spin, and who will give the American people the truth about the challenge our brave men and women face on the front lines.\nThe hard truth is that our president has made serious mistakes in taking us to war with Iraq. He was wrong to rush to war without giving the inspectors time to do their job. He was wrong to rush to war without understanding and planning for the post-war in Iraq – which itself has become an ongoing conflict. He was wrong to rush to war without the allies we needed by our side. He was wrong to send our troops into battle without the equipment they need to do their jobs. He was wrong to ignore the best advice of America's own military – including his own Army Chief of Staff – about how many troops we needed to accomplish our mission. So when it comes to Iraq, it's not that I would have done one thing differently than President Bush – I would have done almost everything differently.\nAnd today, because of his wrong choices, America has borne nearly 90% of the casualties, and paid nearly 90% of the bill in Iraq. Contrast that with the first Gulf War, where our allies paid 95% of the costs.\nAnd perhaps worst of all, the mess in Iraq has set us back – way back – in the war on terror. The simple fact is, when it comes to the war on terror, George W. Bush has taken his eye off the ball.\nIn the months after September 11th, our troops were doing a magnificent job in Afghanistan, and they were hot on the trail of Osama bin Laden. But instead of staying the course and letting them finish the job, George W. Bush turned over critical military operations in Tora Bora to a band of warlords. As a result, Osama bin Laden escaped, and we haven't seen him since.\nAnd today, three years after September 11th, Al Qaeda is operating in 60 countries, and gaining a whole new generation of recruits. And again and again, on the evening news, we see videotapes from bin Laden or his top lieutenants. This administration has said bluntly: It is not a matter of if al Qaeda attacks here at home – it is a question of when.\nI believe America can do better than we're doing. We simply cannot afford four more years of wrong choices that undermine our security and our standing in the world.\nI also believe that despite the miscalculations, it is not too late to turn things around in Iraq and in our global war on terror. But we need a leadership that sees a better set of choices – better options for getting the job done. Who will bring in our allies. Who will train Iraqi forces at the right pace with the right partners, so our troops can finally come home. Who will never mislead you about the realities you face on the battlefield. And when I'm your Commander-in-Chief, that is exactly what I will do.\nWe all know too well that after September 11th, we face a new and mortal threat. Terrorist groups like al Qaeda and its copycat killers are claiming the right to execute the innocent. They confuse murder with martyrdom and fanaticism with faith. They use terror as a sword and religion as a shield.\nThey present the central national security challenge of our generation. But they are unlike any other adversary our nation has ever confronted. They have no president, capital city, territory, army, or national identity. We are not absolutely certain how they are organized or how many operatives they have. But we know the destruction they can inflict. We saw it at the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon, in a field in rural Pennsylvania. We saw the carnage, the unbearable carnage, in a school in Russia. We have seen it in Indonesia, in Bali and Madrid, in Israel and across the Middle East. And just imagine what the terrorists would do if they got their hands on nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\nIn this new era, it is imperative that we modernize the world's most powerful military – that we build a 21st century military to meet these 21st century threats. Today, we need a stronger, more modern, better-prepared military to meet the challenges of the post-9/11 world.\nAs President, I will start by expanding America's active duty forces. Today, our armed services are stretched far too thin. Nine out of ten active duty Army divisions are committed to Iraq – either currently there, preparing to go, or recently returned.\nThe war has been especially tough on the Army's critical post-war specialists. Civil affairs. Military police. Combat support units. Psychological operations units. All are in short supply. All are nearly exhausted.\nAnd since September 11th, we've called on our National Guard like never before. Today, 40 percent of our forces in Iraq are from the Guard and Reserve. Far too many of you have been on the ground for far too long – much longer than was expected or promised. Far too many of you face additional deployments in the months and years ahead. And a new government report warns that soon, we might not even have enough National Guard and Reserve troops to fight the war on terror.\nThat's why, as President, I will add 40,000 new soldiers to our armed forces -- not to increase the number of soldiers in Iraq, but to help prevent and prepare for other possible conflicts.\nI will also double our Army Special Forces to hunt down the terrorists. In Afghanistan, after September 11th, our Special Forces fought the Taliban with remarkable skill. We saw what they could do during the Iraq war, when two teams of American Green Berets totaling 31 men worked with Kurdish troops to defeat an Iraqi force numbering in the hundreds. The victory at the battle of Debecka Pass is a tribute to the flexibility, training, and courage of our Special Forces.\nOf course, the battles of today don't just require more manpower. Today, more than ever before, we are facing new threats which require innovative solutions. And that is the third part of my plan – equipping our military with 21st century technology to defeat 21st century enemies.\nNowhere is this more important than when it comes to the threat of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. The stark truth is that today, we've got to be prepared for a worst case scenario in which deadly weapons technology falls into the wrong hands. That's why, as president, I will create new forces that specialize in finding, securing, and destroying weapons of mass destruction and the facilities that build them. Failing to do this simply isn't an option.\nFinally, if there's one thing we've all learned in the war on terror, it's that, even if we have the troops and technology we need, America can't lead abroad unless we're secure at home. And this Administration has mismanaged a key asset in keeping America safe – our National Guard.\nThe National Guard was intended to complement, not be a substitute for, active duty forces. Many of you are our first responders here at home – fire fighters, police officers, and emergency medical technicians. To take you out of your communities is to take down our critical first line of defense. That's no way to protect America.\nAs President, I will recognize that homeland security is a Constitutionally-mandated mission of the National Guard. In addition to their current duties overseas, I will assign Guard units an additional mission to a standing joint task force, commanded by a General from the Guard. This task force will prepare, and execute, a coordinated strategy for homeland security, working with the states and the federal government to react in times of crisis. While our military can't solve the entire homeland security challenge, the National Guard can make a real difference in protecting America from terrorism.\nMore than 200 years ago, when America was little more than a collection of colonies on the edge of a vast continent, your predecessors resolved to fight for our independence. Many were young – not much older than children. They had nowhere near enough weapons or training or supplies. They were just ordinary citizens coming together to fight for the land they loved. And together, they defeated an empire.\nTheir commitment to freedom shines on in all you do for our country and our world every single day. It's been said that America \"...will remain the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the brave.\" And today, standing here with all of you, I am confident that the United States of America will always remain the land of the free because it is home to all of you – and you are the brave. As President, I will never forget that our security and our strength begins with you – with a single soldier, standing a single post somewhere in the world. And I will always remain grateful to all of you who do this every day with such grace and such courage.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-09-16", "title": "Remarks at the 126th National Guard Association of the United States General Conference in Las Vegas"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29732", "text": "I am honored to be here at New York University -- one of the great urban universities, not just in New York, but in the world. You have set a high standard for global dialogue and I hope to live up to that tradition today.\nThis election is about choices. The most important choices a President makes are about protecting America... at home and around the world. A president's first obligation is to make America safer, stronger and truer to our ideals.\nOnly a few blocks from here, three years ago, the events of September 11 reminded every American of that obligation. That day brought to our shores the defining struggle of our times: the struggle between freedom and radical fundamentalism. And it made clear that our most important task is to fight... and to win... the war on terrorism.\nWith us today is a remarkable group of women who lost loved ones on September 11th ... and whose support I am honored to have. Not only did they suffer an unbearable loss – they helped us learn the lessons of that terrible time by insisting on the creation of the 9/11 Commission. I ask them to stand. And I thank them on behalf of our country -- and I pledge to them and to you that I will implement the 9-11 recommendations.\nIn fighting the war on terrorism, my principles are straightforward. The terrorists are beyond reason. We must destroy them. As president, I will do whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat our enemies. But billions of people around the world yearning for a better life are open to America's ideals. We must reach them.\nTo win, America must be strong. And America must be smart. The greatest threat we face is the possibility Al Qaeda or other terrorists will get their hands on a nuclear weapon.\nTo prevent that from happening, we must call on the totality of America's strength. Strong alliances, to help us stop the world's most lethal weapons from falling into the most dangerous hands. A powerful military, transformed to meet the new threats of terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. And all of America's power – our diplomacy, our intelligence system, our economic power, the appeal of our values – each of which is critical to making America more secure and preventing a new generation of terrorists from emerging.\nNational security is a central issue in this campaign. We owe it to the American people to have a real debate about the choices President Bush has made... and the choices I would make... to fight and win the war on terror.\nThat means we must have a great honest national debate on Iraq. The President claims it is the centerpiece of his war on terror. In fact, Iraq was a profound diversion from that war and the battle against our greatest enemy, Osama bin Laden and the terrorists. Invading Iraq has created a crisis of historic proportions and, if we do not change course, there is the prospect of a war with no end in sight.\nThis month, we passed a cruel milestone: more than 1,000 Americans lost in Iraq. Their sacrifice reminds us that Iraq remains, overwhelmingly, an American burden. Nearly 90 percent of the troops – and nearly 90 percent of the casualties – are American. Despite the President's claims, this is not a grand coalition.\nOur troops have served with extraordinary bravery, skill and resolve. Their service humbles all of us. When I speak to them... when I look into the eyes of their families, I know this: we owe them the truth about what we have asked them to do... and what is still to be done.\nIn June, the President declared, \"The Iraqi people have their country back.\" Just last week, he told us: \"This country is headed toward democracy... Freedom is on the march.\"\nBut the administration's own official intelligence estimate, given to the President last July, tells a very different story.\nAccording to press reports, the intelligence estimate totally contradicts what the President is saying to the American people.\nSo do the facts on the ground.\nSecurity is deteriorating, for us and for the Iraqis.\n42 Americans died in Iraq in June -- the month before the handover. But 54 died in July...66 in August... and already 54 halfway through September.\nAnd more than 1,100 Americans were wounded in August – more than in any other month since the invasion.\nWe are fighting a growing insurgency in an ever widening war-zone. In March, insurgents attacked our forces 700 times. In August, they attacked 2,700 times – a 400% increase.\nFalluja...Ramadi... Samarra ... even parts of Baghdad – are now \"no go zones\"... breeding grounds for terrorists who are free to plot and launch attacks against our soldiers. The radical Shi'a cleric, Moktada al-Sadr, who's accused of complicity in the murder of Americans, holds more sway in the suburbs of Baghdad.\nViolence against Iraqis... from bombings to kidnappings to intimidation ... is on the rise.\nBasic living conditions are also deteriorating.\nResidents of Baghdad are suffering electricity blackouts lasting up to 14 hours a day.\nRaw sewage fills the streets, rising above the hubcaps of our Humvees. Children wade through garbage on their way to school.\nUnemployment is over 50 percent. Insurgents are able to find plenty of people willing to take $150 for tossing grenades at passing U.S. convoys.\nYes, there has been some progress, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of our soldiers and civilians in Iraq. Schools, shops and hospitals have been opened. In parts of Iraq, normalcy actually prevails.\nBut most Iraqis have lost faith in our ability to deliver meaningful improvements to their lives. So they're sitting on the fence... instead of siding with us against the insurgents.\nThat is the truth. The truth that the Commander in Chief owes to our troops and the American people.\nIt is never easy to discuss what has gone wrong while our troops are in constant danger. But it's essential if we want to correct our course and do what's right for our troops instead of repeating the same mistakes over and over again.\nI know this dilemma first-hand. After serving in war, I returned home to offer my own personal voice of dissent. I did so because I believed strongly that we owed it those risking their lives to speak truth to power. We still do.\nSaddam Hussein was a brutal dictator who deserves his own special place in hell. But that was not, in itself, a reason to go to war. The satisfaction we take in his downfall does not hide this fact: we have traded a dictator for a chaos that has left America less secure.\nThe President has said that he \"miscalculated\" in Iraq and that it was a \"catastrophic success.\" In fact, the President has made a series of catastrophic decisions ... from the beginning ... in Iraq. At every fork in the road, he has taken the wrong turn and led us in the wrong direction.\nThe first and most fundamental mistake was the President's failure to tell the truth to the American people.\nHe failed to tell the truth about the rationale for going to war. And he failed to tell the truth about the burden this war would impose on our soldiers and our citizens.\nBy one count, the President offered 23 different rationales for this war. If his purpose was to confuse and mislead the American people, he succeeded.\nHis two main rationales – weapons of mass destruction and the Al Qaeda/September 11 connection – have been proved false... by the President's own weapons inspectors... and by the 9/11 Commission. Just last week, Secretary of State Powell acknowledged the facts. Only Vice President Cheney still insists that the earth is flat.\nThe President also failed to level with the American people about what it would take to prevail in Iraq.\nHe didn't tell us that well over 100,000 troops would be needed, for years, not months. He didn't tell us that he wouldn't take the time to assemble a broad and strong coalition of allies. He didn't tell us that the cost would exceed $200 billion. He didn't tell us that even after paying such a heavy price, success was far from assured.\nAnd America will pay an even heavier price for the President's lack of candor.\nAt home, the American people are less likely to trust this administration if it needs to summon their support to meet real and pressing threats to our security.\nAbroad, other countries will be reluctant to follow America when we seek to rally them against a common menace -- as they are today. Our credibility in the world has plummeted.\nIn the dark days of the Cuban Missile Crisis, President Kennedy sent former Secretary of State Dean Acheson to Europe to build support. Acheson explained the situation to French President de Gaulle. Then he offered to show him highly classified satellite photos, as proof. De Gaulle waved the photos away, saying: \"The word of the President of the United States is good enough for me.\"\nHow many world leaders have that same trust in America's president, today?\nThis President's failure to tell the truth to us before the war has been exceeded by fundamental errors of judgment during and after the war.\nThe President now admits to \"miscalculations\" in Iraq.\nThat is one of the greatest understatements in recent American history. His were not the equivalent of accounting errors. They were colossal failures of judgment – and judgment is what we look for in a president.\nThis is all the more stunning because we're not talking about 20/20 hindsight. Before the war, before he chose to go to war, bi-partisan Congressional hearings... major outside studies... and even some in the administration itself... predicted virtually every problem we now face in Iraq.\nThis President was in denial. He hitched his wagon to the ideologues who surround him, filtering out those who disagreed, including leaders of his own party and the uniformed military. The result is a long litany of misjudgments with terrible consequences.\nThe administration told us we'd be greeted as liberators. They were wrong.\nThey told us not to worry about looting or the sorry state of Iraq's infrastructure. They were wrong.\nThey told us we had enough troops to provide security and stability, defeat the insurgents, guard the borders and secure the arms depots. They were wrong.\nThey told us we could rely on exiles like Ahmed Chalabi to build political legitimacy. They were wrong.\nThey told us we would quickly restore an Iraqi civil service to run the country and a police force and army to secure it. They were wrong.\nIn Iraq, this administration has consistently over-promised and under-performed. This policy has been plagued by a lack of planning, an absence of candor, arrogance and outright incompetence. And the President has held no one accountable, including himself.\nIn fact, the only officials who lost their jobs over Iraq were the ones who told the truth.\nGeneral Shinseki said it would take several hundred thousand troops to secure Iraq. He was retired. Economic adviser Larry Lindsey said that Iraq would cost as much as $200 billion. He was fired. After the successful entry into Baghdad, George Bush was offered help from the UN -- and he rejected it. He even prohibited any nation from participating in reconstruction efforts that wasn't part of the original coalition – pushing reluctant countries even farther away. As we continue to fight this war almost alone, it is hard to estimate how costly that arrogant decision was. Can anyone seriously say this President has handled Iraq in a way that makes us stronger in the war on terrorism?\nBy any measure, the answer is no. Nuclear dangers have mounted across the globe. The international terrorist club has expanded. Radicalism in the Middle East is on the rise. We have divided our friends and united our enemies. And our standing in the world is at an all time low.\nThink about it for a minute. Consider where we were... and where we are. After the events of September 11, we had an opportunity to bring our country and the world together in the struggle against the terrorists. On September 12th, headlines in newspapers abroad declared \"we are all Americans now.\" But through his policy in Iraq, the President squandered that moment and rather than isolating the terrorists, left America isolated from the world.\nWe now know that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction and posed no imminent threat to our security. It had not, as the Vice President claimed, \"reconstituted nuclear weapons.\"\nThe President's policy in Iraq took our attention and resources away from other, more serious threats to America.\nThreats like North Korea, which actually has weapons of mass destruction, including a nuclear arsenal, and is building more under this President's watch...\n... The emerging nuclear danger from Iran...\n... The tons and kilotons of unsecured chemical and nuclear weapons in Russia...\n... And the increasing instability in Afghanistan.\nToday, warlords again control much of that country, the Taliban is regrouping, opium production is at an all time high and the Al Qaeda leadership still plots and plans, not only there but in 60 other nations. Instead of using U.S. forces, we relied on the warlords to capture Osama bin Laden when he was cornered in the mountains. He slipped away. We then diverted our focus and forces from the hunt for those responsible for September 11th in order to invade Iraq.\nWe know Iraq played no part in September 11 and had no operational ties to Al Qaeda.\nThe President's policy in Iraq precipitated the very problem he said he was trying to prevent. Secretary of State Powell admits that Iraq was not a magnet for international terrorists before the war. Now it is, and they are operating against our troops. Iraq is becoming a sanctuary for a new generation of terrorists who someday could hit the United States.\nWe know that while Iraq was a source of friction, it was not previously a source of serious disagreement with our allies in Europe and countries in the Muslim world.\nThe President's policy in Iraq divided our oldest alliance and sent our standing in the Muslim world into free fall. Three years after 9/11, even in many moderate Muslim countries like Jordan, Morocco and Turkey, Osama bin Laden is more popular than the United States of America.\nLet me put it plainly: The President's policy in Iraq has not strengthened our national security. It has weakened it.\nTwo years ago, Congress was right to give the President the authority to use force to hold Saddam Hussein accountable. This President... any President... would have needed the threat of force to act effectively. This President misused that authority.\nThe power entrusted to the President gave him a strong hand to play in the international community. The idea was simple. We would get the weapons inspectors back in to verify whether or not Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. And we would convince the world to speak with one voice to Saddam: disarm or be disarmed.\nA month before the war, President Bush told the nation: \"If we have to act, we will take every precaution that is possible. We will plan carefully. We will act with the full power of the United States military. We will act with allies at our side and we will prevail.\" He said that military action wasn't \"unavoidable.\"\nInstead, the President rushed to war without letting the weapons inspectors finish their work. He went without a broad and deep coalition of allies. He acted without making sure our troops had enough body armor. And he plunged ahead without understanding or preparing for the consequences of the post-war. None of which I would have done.\nYet today, President Bush tells us that he would do everything all over again, the same way. How can he possibly be serious? Is he really saying that if we knew there were no imminent threat, no weapons of mass destruction, no ties to Al Qaeda, the United States should have invaded Iraq? My answer is no – because a Commander-in-Chief's first responsibility is to make a wise and responsible decision to keep America safe.\nNow the president, in looking for a new reason, tries to hang his hat on the \"capability\" to acquire weapons. But that was not the reason given to the nation; it was not the reason Congress voted on; it's not a reason, it's an excuse. Thirty-five to forty countries have greater capability to build a nuclear bomb than Iraq did in 2003. Is President Bush saying we should invade them?\nI would have concentrated our power and resources on defeating global terrorism and capturing or killing Osama bin Laden. I would have tightened the noose and continued to pressure and isolate Saddam Hussein – who was weak and getting weaker -- so that he would pose no threat to the region or America.\nThe President's insistence that he would do the same thing all over again in Iraq is a clear warning for the future. And it makes the choice in this election clear: more of the same with President Bush or a new direction that makes our troops and America safer. It is time, at long last, to ask the questions and insist on the answers from the Commander-in-Chief about his serious misjudgments and what they tell us about his administration and the President himself. If George W. Bush is re-elected, he will cling to the same failed policies in Iraq -- and he will repeat, somewhere else, the same reckless mistakes that have made America less secure than we can or should be.\nIn Iraq, we have a mess on our hands. But we cannot throw up our hands. We cannot afford to see Iraq become a permanent source of terror that will endanger America's security for years to come.\nAll across this country people ask me what we should do now. Every step of the way, from the time I first spoke about this in the Senate, I have set out specific recommendations about how we should and should not proceed. But over and over, when this administration has been presented with a reasonable alternative, they have rejected it and gone their own way. This is stubborn incompetence.\nFive months ago, in Fulton, Missouri, I said that the President was close to his last chance to get it right. Every day, this President makes it more difficult to deal with Iraq – harder than it was five months ago, harder than it was a year ago. It is time to recognize what is – and what is not – happening in Iraq today. And we must act with urgency.\nJust this weekend, a leading Republican, Chuck Hagel, said we're \"in deep trouble in Iraq ... it doesn't add up ... to a pretty picture [and] ... we're going to have to look at a recalibration of our policy.\" Republican leaders like Dick Lugar and John McCain have offered similar assessments.\nWe need to turn the page and make a fresh start in Iraq.\nFirst, the President has to get the promised international support so our men and women in uniform don't have to go it alone. It is late; the President must respond by moving this week to gain and regain international support.\nLast spring, after too many months of resistance and delay, the President finally went back to the U.N. which passed Resolution 1546. It was the right thing to do – but it was late.\nThat resolution calls on U.N. members to help in Iraq by providing troops... trainers for Iraq's security forces... a special brigade to protect the U.N. mission... more financial assistance... and real debt relief.\nThree months later, not a single country has answered that call. And the president acts as if it doesn't matter.\nAnd of the $13 billion previously pledged to Iraq by other countries, only $1.2 billion has been delivered.\nThe President should convene a summit meeting of the world's major powers and Iraq's neighbors, this week, in New York, where many leaders will attend the U.N. General Assembly. He should insist that they make good on that U.N. resolution. He should offer potential troop contributors specific, but critical roles, in training Iraqi security personnel and securing Iraq's borders. He should give other countries a stake in Iraq's future by encouraging them to help develop Iraq's oil resources and by letting them bid on contracts instead of locking them out of the reconstruction process.\nThis will be difficult. I and others have repeatedly recommended this from the very beginning. Delay has made only made it harder. After insulting allies and shredding alliances, this President may not have the trust and confidence to bring others to our side in Iraq. But we cannot hope to succeed unless we rebuild and lead strong alliances so that other nations share the burden with us. That is the only way to succeed.\nSecond, the President must get serious about training Iraqi security forces.\nLast February, Secretary Rumsfeld claimed that more than 210,000 Iraqis were in uniform. Two weeks ago, he admitted that claim was exaggerated by more than 50 percent. Iraq, he said, now has 95,000 trained security forces.\nBut guess what? Neither number bears any relationship to the truth. For example, just 5,000 Iraqi soldiers have been fully trained, by the administration's own minimal standards. And of the 35,000 police now in uniform, not one has completed a 24-week field-training program. Is it any wonder that Iraqi security forces can't stop the insurgency or provide basic law and order?\nThe President should urgently expand the security forces training program inside and outside Iraq. He should strengthen the vetting of recruits, double classroom training time, and require follow-on field training. He should recruit thousands of qualified trainers from our allies, especially those who have no troops in Iraq. He should press our NATO allies to open training centers in their countries. And he should stop misleading the American people with phony, inflated numbers.\nThird, the President must carry out a reconstruction plan that finally brings tangible benefits to the Iraqi people.\nLast week, the administration admitted that its plan was a failure when it asked Congress for permission to radically revise spending priorities in Iraq. It took 17 months for them to understand that security is a priority ... 17 months to figure out that boosting oil production is critical ... 17 months to conclude that an Iraqi with a job is less likely to shoot at our soldiers.\nOne year ago, the administration asked for and received $18 billion to help the Iraqis and relieve the conditions that contribute to the insurgency. Today, less than a $1 billion of those funds have actually been spent. I said at the time that we had to rethink our policies and set standards of accountability. Now we're paying the price.\nNow, the President should look at the whole reconstruction package...draw up a list of high visibility, quick impact projects... and cut through the red tape. He should use more Iraqi contractors and workers, instead of big corporations like Halliburton. He should stop paying companies under investigation for fraud or corruption. And he should fire the civilians in the Pentagon responsible for mismanaging the reconstruction effort.\nFourth, the President must take immediate, urgent, essential steps to guarantee the promised elections can be held next year.\nCredible elections are key to producing an Iraqi government that enjoys the support of the Iraqi people and an assembly to write a Constitution that yields a viable power sharing arrangement.\nBecause Iraqis have no experience holding free and fair elections, the President agreed six months ago that the U.N. must play a central role. Yet today, just four months before Iraqis are supposed to go to the polls, the U.N. Secretary General and administration officials themselves say the elections are in grave doubt. Because the security situation is so bad... and because not a single country has offered troops to protect the U.N. elections mission... the U.N. has less than 25 percent of the staff it needs in Iraq to get the job done.\nThe President should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a U.N. protection force. This won't be easy. But even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in Iraq should still help protect the U.N. We should also intensify the training of Iraqis to manage and guard the polling places that need to be opened. Otherwise, U.S forces would end up bearing those burdens alone.\nIf the President would move in this direction ... if he would bring in more help from other countries to provide resources and forces ... train the Iraqis to provide their own security ...develop a reconstruction plan that brings real benefits to the Iraqi people ... and take the steps necessary to hold credible elections next year ... we could begin to withdraw U.S. forces starting next summer and realistically aim to bring all our troops home within the next four years.\nThis is what has to be done. This is what I would do as President today. But we cannot afford to wait until January. President Bush owes it to the American people to tell the truth and put Iraq on the right track. Even more, he owes it to our troops and their families, whose sacrifice is a testament to the best of America.\nThe principles that should guide American policy in Iraq now and in the future are clear: We must make Iraq the world's responsibility, because the world has a stake in the outcome and others should share the burden. We must effectively train Iraqis, because they should be responsible for their own security. We must move forward with reconstruction, because that's essential to stop the spread of terror. And we must help Iraqis achieve a viable government, because it's up to them to run their own country. That's the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home.\nOn May 1 of last year, President Bush stood in front of a now infamous banner that read \"Mission Accomplished.\" He declared to the American people: \"In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed.\" In fact, the worst part of the war was just beginning, with the greatest number of American casualties still to come. The president misled, miscalculated, and mismanaged every aspect of this undertaking and he has made the achievement of our objective – a stable Iraq, secure within its borders, with a representative government, harder to achieve.\nIn Iraq, this administration's record is filled with bad predictions, inaccurate cost estimates, deceptive statements and errors of judgment of historic proportions.\nAt every critical juncture in Iraq, and in the war on terrorism, the President has made the wrong choice. I have a plan to make America stronger.\nThe President often says that in a post 9-11 world, we can't hesitate to act. I agree. But we should not act just for the sake of acting. I believe we have to act wisely and responsibly.\nGeorge Bush has no strategy for Iraq. I do.\nGeorge Bush has not told the truth to the American people about why we went to war and how the war is going. I have and I will continue to do so.\nI believe the invasion of Iraq has made us less secure and weaker in the war against terrorism. I have a plan to fight a smarter, more effective war on terror – and make us safer.\nToday, because of George Bush's policy in Iraq, the world is a more dangerous place for America and Americans.\nIf you share my conviction that we can not go on as we are ...that we can make America stronger and safer than it is... then November 2 is your chance to speak... and to be heard. It is not a question of staying the course, but of changing the course.\nI'm convinced that with the right leadership, we can create a fresh start and move more effectively to accomplish our goals. Our troops have served with extraordinary courage and commitment. For their sake, and America's sake, we must get this right. We must do everything in our power to complete the mission and make America stronger at home and respected again in the world.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2004-09-20", "title": "Remarks at New York University"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29733", "text": "It's an honor to be here today at Temple University, one of America's leading public research universities, in the city where America was born. Like the great Philadelphian Ben Franklin, you have a proud tradition of seeking answers to the defining questions of our time. I hope to follow in that tradition this morning.\nMy fellow Americans, the most urgent national security challenge we face is the war against those who attacked our country on September 11th, the war against Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. As president, I will fight a tougher, smarter, more effective war on terror. My priority will be to find and capture or kill the terrorists before they get us.\nWhen we look at the images of children brutalized by remorseless terrorists in Russia, we know that this is not just a political or military struggle – it goes to the very heart of what we value most – our families. It strikes at the bond between a mother and child. As president, I will make it my sacred duty to be able to say to every mother and father in this country, I am doing everything in my power to keep your children safe.\nWe owe the American people a real debate about the choices President Bush has made... and the choices I will make... to fight and win the war against terrorism.\nPresident Bush was right to invade Afghanistan and overthrow the Taliban. I supported that decision. So did our country and our allies. So did the world.\nBut since then, again and again, the President has made the wrong choices in the war on terror... around the world and here at home.\nInstead of using U.S. forces to capture Osama bin Laden... the President outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who let bin Laden slip away. That was the wrong choice.\nInstead of finishing the job in Afghanistan... the President rushed to a new war in Iraq. That was the wrong choice.\nInstead of listening to the uniformed military, his own State Department, Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress, and outside experts about how to win the peace in Iraq... the President hitched his wagon to the ideologues who told him our troops would be welcomed as liberators. That was the wrong choice.\nInstead of responding to the greatest intelligence failure in our history with a rapid overhaul of our intelligence system ... the President dragged his feet and actually resisted reform. After opposing the 9/11 Commission, after trying to block its extension, after finally agreeing to testify, but only with Vice President Cheney at his side, he still refuses to fully implement the Commission's recommendations. Those were the wrong choices.\nInstead of proposing a Department of Homeland Security ... the President actually opposed it – and then exploited it for political purposes. That was the wrong choice.\nInstead of expanding programs to keep weapons of mass destruction in Russia out of terrorist hands... the President first tried to cut the programs... and even after 9/11 did too little to strengthen them. That was the wrong choice.\nInstead of facing the urgent nuclear dangers in North Korea and Iran... he allowed these dangers to mount on his presidential watch. That was the wrong choice.\nInstead of speaking forcefully to the Saudis and others about terrorist financing ... the President has said little and done less. That was the wrong choice.\nInstead of providing our police, firefighters, and ambulance drivers with the equipment they need... instead of protecting ports, trains, subway lines and highways... instead of defending nuclear plants and chemical factories... this President under-funded homeland security. That was the wrong choice.\nInstead of bringing the world together against the terrorists... the President alienated the countries whose help we need to defeat them. That was the wrong choice.\nYet, in the face of all the misjudgments, all the miscalculations, and all the mistakes, the president still says he wouldn't do anything different. I would. I will make very different choices in the war on terrorism. I know what has gone wrong... and what needs to be done.\nI begin with this belief: The war on terror is as monumental a struggle as the Cold War. Its outcome will determine whether we and our children live in freedom or in fear. It is not, as some people think, a clash of civilizations. Radical Islamic fundamentalism is not the true face of Islam. This is a clash between civilization and the enemies of civilization; between humanity's best hopes and most primitive fears. The danger we face today will become even greater if the terrorists acquire what we know they are seeking – weapons of mass destruction, which they would use to commit mass murder. We are confronting an enemy and an ideology that must be destroyed. We are in a war that must be won.\nAmericans know this. We understand the stakes. On September 11th there were no Democrats, no Republicans. We were only Americans. We all stood together. We all supported the President. We all prayed for victory, because we love our country and despise everything our enemies stand for.\nBut three years after 9/11, we see our enemies striking -- in Spain, in Turkey, in Indonesia, in Kenya, and now every day -- in the most despicable and gruesome ways in Iraq, which was not a terrorist haven before the invasion. In fact, there were more terrorist attacks in the world last year than the year before. And we see an administration in confusion; we hear the president, the commander in chief, proclaiming one day that this war can't be won and then saying something different the next day. And we hear the Secretary of Defense himself wondering whether the radicals are recruiting, training, and deploying more terrorists than we're capturing or killing.\nThen, yesterday, when asked about conditions in Iraq, Secretary Rumsfeld told Congress, and I quote: \"Let's pretend, hypothetically, that you get to election time in January and let's pretend that it's roughly like it is, or a little worse, which it could be, because you've got to expect it to continue....So be it, nothing is perfect in life.\" If there was any doubt that the leaders of the Bush Administration are living in a fantasy world of spin, I think Secretary Rumsfeld put that doubt to rest.\nWe need to end this confusion. We need national leaders who will face reality – not only in Iraq but in the war on terror. And we need a president who has no doubt that the war on terror can and must be won.\nThe invasion of Iraq was a profound diversion from the battle against our greatest enemy – Al Qaeda -- which killed more than three thousand people on 9/11 and which still plots our destruction today. And there's just no question about it: the President's misjudgment, miscalculation and mismanagement of the war in Iraq all make the war on terror harder to win. Iraq is now what it was not before the war – a haven for terrorists. George Bush made Saddam Hussein the priority. I would have made Osama bin Laden the priority. As president, I will finish the job in Iraq and refocus our energies on the real war on terror.\nI will wage this war relentlessly with a single-minded determination: to capture or kill the terrorists, crush their movement and free the world from fear. To destroy our enemy, we have to know our enemy. We have to understand that we are facing a radical fundamentalist movement with global reach and a very specific plan. They are not just out to kill us for the sake of killing us. They want to provoke a conflict that will radicalize the people of the Muslim world, turning them against the United States and the West. And they hope to transform that anger into a force that will topple the region's governments and pave the way for a new empire, an oppressive, fundamentalist superstate stretching across a vast area from Europe to Africa, from the Middle East to Central Asia.\nThe American people have a right to hear the answer to a fundamental question: How are we going to win this war? What is our strategy for eliminating the terrorists, discrediting their cause, and smashing their forces so that America can actually be safer?\nEvery week too many American families grieve for loved ones killed in Iraq by terrorist forces that weren't even there before the invasion. The jihadist movement that hates us is gaining adherents around the world. An estimated 18,000 al Qaeda trained militants are operating in 60 countries around the world in a dangerous and more elusive network of extremist groups. Al Qaeda shouldn't be hitting us anywhere. They should be losing, everywhere. We should be winning, everywhere.\nThat will take time. It will not be easy. But it can be done. And I have a comprehensive strategy for victory over terrorism.\nFirst, I will build a stronger, smarter military and intelligence capability to capture or kill our enemies.\nAs president, I will expand our Army by 40,000 troops so that we have more soldiers to find and fight the enemy. I will double our Army Special Forces capacity. And we will accelerate the development and deployment of new technologies to track down and bring down terrorists.\nI will strengthen our intelligence system to detect and stop the terrorists before they can strike. By the morning of September 12th, everyone in America knew that our intelligence wasn't as good as it needed to be. But three years later, believe it or not, we read that the CIA unit charged with finding bin Laden has fewer experienced case officers today than it had before 9/11.\nWhen I am president, that will change. I will act immediately to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations. I will create a National Intelligence Director with all the budget and personnel authority the Commission says is needed to keep us safe. I will double our overseas clandestine service, train the linguists and Arab experts we need, and make sure the operation – hunting down bin Laden and al Qaeda -- has all the resources it needs.\nI will make Afghanistan a priority again, because it is still the front line in the war on terror.\nAs president, I will not subcontract the fight to warlords who are out for nothing but power and personal gain. I will help the government of Afghanistan expand its authority beyond Kabul to the rest of the country. I will lead our allies to share the burden, so that NATO finally provides more troops. I will show the world that America finishes what it begins.\nSecond, I will move decisively to deny the terrorists the deadly weapons they seek.\nThose weapons were not in Iraq. But tons and kilotons of poorly secured chemical and nuclear weapons are spread throughout the former Soviet Union. Twelve years ago, we began a bipartisan program to help these nations secure and destroy those weapons. It is incredible – and unacceptable -- that in the three years after 9/11, President Bush hasn't stepped up our effort to lock down the loose nuclear weapons and materials in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere. More such materials were secured in the two years before 9/11 than in the two years after.\nWhen I'm president, denying our most dangerous enemies the world's most dangerous weapons will become the central priority for America.\nI will secure all nuclear weapons and materials in the former Soviet Union within four years. At President Bush's pace, it will take 13 years.\nI will seek a verifiable global ban on the production of materials for nuclear weapons.\nNowhere is the nuclear danger more urgent than in Iran and North Korea.\nThis week, Iran announced its intention to process enough raw uranium to create five nuclear weapons.\nI will make it clear to Iran that we will lead an international effort to impose tough sanctions if they do not permanently suspend their uranium enrichment program and provide verifiable assurances that they are not developing nuclear weapons.\nYesterday, there were reports that North Korea are preparing to fire an intermediate-range ballistic missile that may be able to carry a nuclear warhead. I will work with our allies to get the six party talks with North Korea back on track -- and I will talk directly with the North Koreans -- to get a verifiable agreement that will eliminate their nuclear weapons program completely and irreversibly. We have to get serious about diplomacy with North Korea now. Only then will we have the support of our allies for action if diplomacy fails.\nThird, as president, I will wage a war on terrorist finances every bit as total as the war we wage on the terrorists themselves. We will trace terrorist funds to their sources and freeze the assets of anyone -- any person, bank, business or foreign official -- who is financing terrorism. I know how to do this. As Senator, I exposed and helped dismantle an international bank that was one of the early financiers of terrorism. We did it by following the money. We can and must do the same to choke off the dollars that are funding al Qaeda and its allies. On this, I will grant no one a \"free pass.\"\nAs president, I will do what President Bush has not: I will hold the Saudis accountable. Since 9/11, there have been no public prosecutions in Saudi Arabia, and few elsewhere, of terrorist financers. I will work with our allies, with the World Bank and international financial institutions to shut down the financial pipeline that keeps terrorism alive. And I will pursue a plan to make this nation energy independent of Mid East oil. I want an America that relies on our own innovation and ingenuity, not the Saudi Royal Family.\nFourth, as president, I will make homeland security a real priority by offering a real plan, and backing it with real resources.\nThe first task is to prevent terrorists and their tools of destruction from entering our country.\nWe know that al Qaeda members and other terrorists could cross into America from Mexico and Canada. We are now told that America's borders have grown even more porous since September 11. And 9/11 Commission staff report that our border inspectors don't even have the \"training\" and \"basic intelligence\" information to keep out terrorists.\nAt our seaports we're physically inspecting only 5% of the cargo coming into America. The Bush Administration is spending more in Iraq in four days than they've spent protecting our ports for all of the last three years.\nAt our airports, there has been some progress, but there is far more to do. According to news accounts, the terrorist aviation list only includes those who are a danger to aviation. This is ridiculous. It should include every suspected terrorist who is a danger to anything, anywhere in our country.\nTerrorists used explosives to bring down two planes in Russia. Yet here in America, the system for detecting explosives carried by passengers fails to pass our own government's tests. And here's something that makes no sense at all: your luggage is x-rayed when it's put on the plane, but the cargo on the hold underneath seldom is.\nThis has to change. In a Kerry-Edwards Administration, we'll give inspectors at our borders access to the terrorist watch lists. At our ports, we will provide a 600 percent increase in support for the most promising cargo inspection programs. In our airports, we'll install the equipment to check passengers for explosives to screen cargo just like we screen baggage. And across the country, we will make sure our police, firefighters, and ambulance drivers have the latest radios, hazmat suits, decontamination facilities, and emergency operation centers they need to respond effectively in a crisis.\nThis is all common sense; but none of it is a priority for the Bush Administration. Here's what's on their agenda. Costly new nuclear weapons we don't need that risk fueling a new arms race. And committing to a missile defense system that could eventually cost $100 billion doesn't yet work and won't stop likely threats to our security.\nNear here, in the Philadelphia region, there are eight chemical plants where a terrorist attack could endanger a million people. But this President allowed the chemical industry to derail commonsense measures for chemical plant security. As president, I will protect them.\nAt a time when police officers are more critical than ever to our homeland security, this President gutted the program to put 100,000 new police on our streets. I will restore that funding and make sure the money reaches our first responders.\nThis President has failed to provide even a nickel in his budget to safeguard our railroads and subways – leaving millions of people every day more vulnerable to terrorist attacks. We will invest more than $2 billion in new funding to protect our transit systems, so that what happened in Madrid doesn't happen here.\nFifth, as we go after the terrorists and secure our homeland, I will focus on the long-term frontline of this war. To defeat the terrorists' aims, we must deny them recruits and safe havens.\nFor al Qaeda, this war is a struggle for the heart and soul of the Muslim world. We will win this war only if the terrorists lose that struggle. We will win when ordinary people from Nigeria to Egypt to Pakistan to Indonesia know they have more to live for than to die for. We will win when they once again see America as the champion, not the enemy, of their legitimate yearning to live in just and peaceful societies. We will win when we stop isolating ourselves and start isolating our enemies. The world knows the difference between empty promises and genuine commitment.\nSo we will win when we show that America uses its economic power for the common good, doing our share to defeat the abject poverty, hunger, and disease that destroy lives and create failed states in every part of the world. The world's poorest countries, suffering under crushing debt burdens, need particular attention. As president, I will lead the international community to cancel the debt of the most vulnerable nations in return for them living up to goals of social and economic progress.\nWe will win when we work with our allies, to enable children in poor countries to get a quality basic education. More than 50 percent of the population in the Arab and Muslim world is under the age of 25. The future is a race between schools that spark learning and schools that teach hate. We have to preempt the haters. We have to win the war of ideas. New generations must believe there is more to life than salvation through martyrdom.\nSixth, we will promote the development of free and democratic societies throughout the Arab and Muslim world. Millions of people there share our values of human rights, and our hopes for a better life for the next generation. They are facing their own struggle at home against the forces of fanaticism and militancy. They are our natural allies. Their lost trust in our intentions must be restored. We must reach out to them and yes we must always promote democracy. I will be clear with repressive governments in the region that we expect to see them change – not just for our sake but for their own survival.\nAs president, I will lead a massive national effort to improve our outreach to the Muslim world. We will train a new generation of American scholars, diplomats, and military officers, who know this region just as we built our knowledge of the Soviet Empire during the Cold War. I will convene a summit with our European partners and leaders from the Muslim world to strengthen mutual understanding, economic growth and the fight against terror.\nLet it be clear that the issue here is advancing democracy in Arab nations, not yielding to pressure to undermine Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East. Our alliance with Israel – the survival and security of Israel – are non-negotiable. The only solution is a Jewish state of Israel living side by side in security and peace with a democratic Palestinian state.\nFinally, we will be stronger if we do not go it alone. As president, I will rebuild and lead strong alliances. This is not only critical to our military operations; it is essential to every other measure we must take, from tracking down terrorists, where we need the intelligence cooperation of other nations, to homeland security, where we need their help to stop terrorists and their weapons before they ever reach our shores.\nWe will not succeed in destroying freedom's adversaries if we are divided from freedom's friends. The terrorists certainly understand that. They are making a special effort to set off bombs in Turkey, Morocco and Indonesia. They want to keep other countries from standing with us in the war on terror. They know what the Bush administration has been so reluctant to admit -- that we are weaker when we fight almost alone. We are safer and stronger, in our capacity to capture and kill terrorists when we fight with allies by our side.\nBut the Bush administration would have you believe that when it comes to our allies, it won't make a difference who is president. They say the Europeans won't help us, no matter what. We're not going to get more cooperation in the war on terror, no matter what. Ordinary people around the world will resent us, no matter what. But I have news for President Bush: just because you can't do something, doesn't mean it can't be done.\nThe first President Bush waged the first Gulf War with a real coalition that fought with us on the battlefield and paid virtually the entire cost of that war. President Clinton built a real coalition in Kosovo, and now virtually every soldier on patrol there comes from a foreign country. During the Cold War, every American president understood what is still true today: The strength of our country is vital but so is the character of our country. It is better to be an America that rallies others to our cause than an America that has to go it alone.\nI believe we can win the war on terror. We can defeat, capture and kill those who commit terror. I have just outlined a strategy for victory.\nI know this struggle will be waged in many ways and many places. I know that it will be a long and difficult struggle. I know we have to be resolute in confronting the evil that exists in the world. But in the end, one of our greatest strengths, one of our greatest safeguards, is that America can be the ideal that inspires others everywhere. If we again become that beacon of hope, we will discover in ourselves the most powerful and useful weapons in the war against the terrorists. Because if we are true to ourselves, terrorists cannot defeat the values and vision that have made America great.\nNo American mother should have to lie awake at night worrying whether her children will be safe at school the next day. No one should fear visiting our nation's capitol or our greatest cities because they might be attacked.\nOur hope – our determination – is nothing less than this: to live our lives confident that we are safe at home and secure in our world. And that is the great victory I will fight for as your President.\nThank you, God bless you and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-09-24", "title": "Remarks at Temple University in Philadelphia"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29734", "text": "Good morning, I'm John Edwards.\nOn Thursday night, America saw John Kerry as our next President. John showed strength, conviction and a steady command of the facts. And he looked and acted like our next Commander-in-Chief.\nJohn left no doubt that he can win the war against terrorism. He laid out a clear plan to hunt down these terrorists and kill them before they harm us. And he offered hope for a fresh start in Iraq so we can finish the job.\nGeorge Bush had a chance to come clean and level with the American people about the failures of his foreign policy. He did not.\nOur military has done everything that it has been asked to do. Our men and women in uniform have acted courageously and heroically. And we are so proud and grateful for their service.\nBut George Bush failed to tell the truth about the mess he has created in Iraq. And it is clear that he still has no plan to win the peace so our troops can come home.\nHe failed to take responsibility for the way in Afghanistan he walked away from the real fight against Al Qaeda and capturing Osama bin Laden.\nHe failed to take responsibility for the fact that he has stood on the sidelines – while the nuclear dangers from North Korea and Iran have grown.\nGeorge Bush cannot fix the mess. He created it. He can't fix it because he even refuses to admit that there's a problem.\nWell, John believes that the best way to lead is with your eyes open so that you have a clear view of the challenges in front of us.\nJohn Kerry laid out our plan to secure the peace in Iraq. We will accelerate the training of Iraqi security forces, step up the Iraq reconstruction plan, make sure the elections go forward, and with a fresh start and a new president, John will restore America's credibility in the world and increase international support to decrease the burden on our troops.\nThey can't solve the problems in Iraq because they don't see them. And it's the exact same thing here at home. They stand up and say that this is the best economy of our lifetime.\nI just spent two days in Ohio. More than 237,000 jobs have been lost. The unemployment rate in Ohio has gone up 60 percent since George Bush took office. Health care costs are skyrocketing. Family incomes are going down. More families are losing their homes than ever before.\nThe struggles people face in Ohio and the weakness in our economy are a direct result of decisions made by George Bush and Dick Cheney. And those decisions are the direct result of a vision that honors wealth and privilege rather than work and responsibility.\nJohn Kerry and I believe to our core that every American deserves the same opportunities to get ahead. That's why we're going to create and keep good paying jobs here in America. We will end tax breaks for companies that ship your jobs overseas and create tax breaks for companies and small businesses for keeping jobs here.\nJohn and I will do this because we know that a job is about more than a paycheck. It's about dignity and self-respect.\nThis is something George Bush and Dick Cheney don't understand. If they did, then their administration wouldn't say that outsourcing American jobs is good for the American economy.\nGeorge Bush and Dick Cheney don't fight to keep your jobs here because they want to help their friends at the top. They are not on your side. Their tax cuts have not helped the middle class. Instead, they've helped people like their friends at Halliburton.\nGeorge Bush and Dick Cheney can find more than $7 billion in no bid contracts for Halliburton. And now that Halliburton is under investigation for overcharging American taxpayers by hundreds of millions of dollars, they make sure that their friends at Halliburton still get the $60 million a month – even though government rules said it should be withheld.\nBut when it comes to what you need – better health care, better paying jobs, more chances for young people to go to college, and a safer America here at home – they say there's no money. They say there's no money for homeland security because they want to protect tax breaks for multimillionaires.\nHalliburton is a symbol of what's wrong with this Administration. It gives special favors for their friends while you struggle just to get by.\nIt is time America had a president who's on your side. And in just thirty one days, you'll have the chance to make that happen and choose your next president. If you believe America is headed in the right direction when millions have lost their health care, more than 1.6 million private sector jobs are gone, and Iraq is a mess, then you should vote for George Bush.\nBut if you believe that America can do better and that we need a new direction, then you should vote for John Kerry.

In the debate on Thursday night, I laid out my plan to win the war in Iraq and bring our troops home. I also stated clearly that as president, I will focus on the real enemy of 9-11 – Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda network. And I will hunt down, capture and kill the terrorists before they get us.\nFor the next month, I will speak to the America people every single day about the war in Iraq and the war on terror, because, as president, my number one priority will be to protect the American people. There is nothing more important.\nGeorge Bush made a colossal error of judgment in Iraq. He promised us that the war in Iraq was his last resort. Instead, it was his first option. He promised he'd plan carefully, but instead he rushed to war without a plan to win the peace. He promised us that we'd have our allies on our side. Instead, America's shouldering nearly 90 percent of the coalition casualties and nearly 90 percent of the cost. Today, more than a thousand brave Americans have died in Iraq. And George Bush says that if he had to do it all over again he wouldn't change a thing.\nThe real test of leadership is how you respond if things go wrong. Do you face the facts and fix the problems? Or do you stick with your story and ignore reality?\nTime and time again, George Bush has proven that he's stubborn, out of touch, and unwilling to change course. He can't see the problems, so he can't solve them. He confuses staying in place with leadership.\nBut it's not just Iraq. Over the past four years, he has made serious misjudgments here at home. Choices that have hurt middle class families like yours.\nIf you asked President Bush, he'd tell you everything's just fine here at home. That this is the best economy of our lifetime. That this is the best that we can do. Maybe that's true for his friends – for Enron, for Halliburton, for the big oil industry. But that's not true for folks like you that I've met all across America.\nThe other day, after a rally in Ohio, a woman asked someone from our campaign to deliver a message to me. She said, \"Senator Kerry, we've got your back.\"\nToday, I've got a message for that woman and every other middle-class American struggling to build a better life for their family: \"I've got yours too.\"\nI've got your back because I know what you're going through. For the last four years, George Bush has turned his back on you and your families with almost every choice he's made. He's given more to those with the most at the expense of middle-class working families who are struggling to get ahead. For them, four more years of Bush choices is four more years they just can't afford.\nMiddle-class families deserve a new choice. And one month from today, they'll have one.\nOne month from today, the American Dream is on the ballot.\nNot too long ago, this dream was within reach of all those willing to work for it. You could find a good job that paid a decent wage. Families were able to save and build a nest egg. When both parents worked, that meant there was more money to buy a house, care for your child, and pay for college. And you were able to give your children more opportunity than you had.\nBut today, for too many families, the dream is harder to reach because of decisions made by this administration. Jobs are shipped overseas, and the ones that replace them don't pay enough to make ends meet. Two incomes barely cover the basics. Health care up 50 percent. College tuition up 35 percent. Gas up 30 percent. Personal bankruptcies are at an all-time high. And the typical family is making $1,500 less each year, while the cost of basic family needs continue to soar.\nBut these aren't just statistics – these are the stories of families I've met all across America. The single mother who lies awake worrying that her child's medicine might cost more than she makes in a month. Moms and dads that save and save and still come up short when they get a bill for tuition or child care that's higher than they thought. The factory worker whose job was sent overseas and now has to take two jobs just to earn what he used to make.\nEvery town I visit, I meet another mother who worries about what kind of America her child will grow up in – will she be able to afford health care? Will she be able to afford college? Will she at least be able to give her the same chances she had? They tell me how hard it is just to get by – never mind getting ahead.\nFor the last two years, I've traveled all over this country and listened to the stories of Americans struggling to make ends meet. I've also shared their frustration at this administration's constant state of denial which neglects their needs.\nJobs are shipped overseas, and the Bush White House says outsourcing is good for us.\nGeorge Bush is the first President to lose jobs in 72 years -- the first president since 1932, back to Herbert Hoover to lose jobs on his watch. And they say it's time to celebrate.\nWages are falling, medical bills are rising, and families can't send their kids to college – and they tell us hey, don't worry, this is the best economy of our lifetime!\nWhen it comes to the struggles middle class families are facing, the truth is George Bush just doesn't get it. This is the man who promised his tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans – those who earn more than $200,000 a year -- would create 6 million new jobs. Today, we've lost a million -- seven million jobs short of his prediction. And what does he want to do now -- even with four years of lost jobs under his belt? He wants to make permanent those same unaffordable tax cuts that don't work for middle class families. This is a man who can't see a problem and can't fix a problem.\nIn fact, the only people George Bush's policies are working for are the people he chooses to help. They're working for drug companies. They're working for oil companies. They're working for HMOs. And they're certainly working for Halliburton.\nGeorge Bush came into office four years ago with a very clear philosophy about how he would run this country. Time and time again, he has made the same choice: to use the power of the presidency to give more and more to those with the most – more to the wealthiest individuals, more to the most well-connected. The result? George Bush doesn't have a record to run on, he has a record to run away from.\nWhen he could have saved American jobs, George Bush chose a proposal to cut taxes for corporations that shipped them overseas and raise taxes on businesses that created jobs here at home.\nThat was his choice. And this is his record: 2.7 million lost manufacturing jobs. That's wrong, and you're paying the price.\nWhen he could have put real tax relief into the pockets of middle-class families who needed it most, George Bush chose massive tax giveaways to those making over $200,000 a year – at a cost of $860 billion. And he calls that \"tax relief.\"\nThat was his choice. And this is his record: a bigger share of the tax bill for middle-class families at a time when they're making $1,500 less a year. That's wrong, and you're paying the price.\nWhen he could have cut the cost of health care and insured more Americans, George Bush chose to propose billions for HMOs and cuts in Medicaid instead.\nThat was his choice. And this is his record: 5 million more uninsured Americans, and a record $3,500 increase in family premiums. That's wrong, and you're paying the price.\nWhen he could have cut the cost of prescription drugs, the Bush administration chose to push through a Medicare bill that gives $139 billion in profits to the big drug companies.\nThat was his choice. And this is his record: a 56% increase in Medicare premiums for seniors. That's wrong, and you're paying the price.\nWhen he could save families hundreds of dollars at the gas pump while reducing America's dependence on foreign oil, George Bush chooses secret meetings with energy executives and he's failed to give the country a serious energy policy.\nThat was his choice. And this is his record: Oil at a record price of $50 a barrel and an America more dependent on foreign energy than ever. That's wrong, and you're paying the price.\nWhen he could have helped more young Americans attend college, George Bush chose to protect a $1 billion guaranteed giveaway to the banks who deal with student loans.\nThat's his choice. And this is his record: 35% tuition increases on his watch, and 220,000 young Americans who can't afford college. That's wrong, and you're paying the price.\nAnd just when you thought it couldn't get worse, I've saved the most outrageous one for last.\nIn the days following 9/11, when our economy was in trouble, our business were hurting, and our people were looking for jobs, so many of us in Congress – Republicans and Democrats alike – called for bold tax cuts that would create jobs, relieve small businesses, invest in our workers, and get our economy moving again.\nGeorge Bush could have joined us. But instead, almost three years ago today, his first priority was to push for his proposal -- a $25 billion giveaway to a handful of corporations – including a $254 million refund check made out to, you guessed it, Enron.\nOver the last four years, George Bush has decided that budget constraints have left him no choice but to propose kicking 500,000 children out of their after school programs, 365,000 children out of their childcare, 500,000 veterans out of the health care system, and 100,000 police officers off the streets.\nMr. President, you owe the country an explanations as to why you thought these families -- veterans and police officers– were not as important as giving Enron $254 million.\nIt was during October of the 2000 election that George Bush looked around at a big dinner in New York and said \"Some people call you the elites; I call you my base.\" He meant it as a joke. Four years of Bush choices and Bush policies later, no one's laughing.\nThat's what he stands for, that's who he's stands for, and if you give him the chance, that's what he'll do for four more years.\nBut if you believe we need a new choice for middle-class families...if you want an America with a growing middle-class where everyone has the chance to work and the opportunity to get ahead, then join us. That's what I stand for, that's who I've fought for, and if you give me the chance, that's where I'll lead this nation as your President.\nJohn Edwards and I have a plan that offers a new choice for middle-class families. It's a four point plan that offers a new choice on jobs, health care, taxes, and energy independence. George Bush has a four word plan: more of the same.\nOur plan starts by offering a new choice on jobs. We can continue to reward the corporations who are shipping our jobs overseas with big tax breaks, or we can fight for the middle-class by creating good jobs here at home.\nWe choose to create jobs at home.\nFirst, we will close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas. Instead, we will use that revenue to reward companies that create and keep good jobs here in the United States of America. And we'll finally put in place the commission that John McCain and I have proposed that he says could cut $60 billion a year in corporate waste.\nSecond, we will help American business grow by cutting the corporate tax rate by five percent, giving 99 percent of businesses a tax break.\nThird, we will help small businesses hire more workers by providing a New Jobs Tax Credit for every small business and manufacturer who decide to add more employees to the payroll.\nFourth, we will have a trade policy that stands up for American workers and opens markets at the same time. Unlike this Administration, I will enforce our trade deals, because I know that if you give the American worker a fair playing field to compete on, there's nobody in the world the American worker can't compete against.\nFinally, we will create the high-tech, high-wage jobs of the future by investing more in our people and their ideas. As president, I push the boundaries of science, and never let ideology get in the way of life-saving research or cutting-edge technology, like stem cell research. We will offer tax credits to help us seize the possibilities of the Broadband Revolution and make Internet access available to all of America's families. And we will give our workers the education and the job training that the jobs of tomorrow require today.\nThis can be our future.\nBut first we must choose. Our plan offers a new choice on taxes. We can continue to give massive tax giveaways to the wealthiest few in our country, or we can fight for the families who are working hard every day offering middle-class tax cuts that make work pay.\nWe choose middle-class tax cuts that bring down the biggest costs facing parents -- so they can get ahead and spend more time with their children.\nFirst, we will help parents cover the rising costs of child care by offering a tax credit of $1,000.\nSecond, we will give more young Americans the chance to go to college by offering a tax break on up to $4,000 in tuition for four years of college.\nThird, we will help Americans meet demands at home and at work by expanding family and medical leave\nFourth, we will offer after school opportunities to another 2 million children, so your kids have a safe place to go while you work.\nAnd finally, we will stop the credit card companies from taking advantage of responsible families with unfair deals.\nTo pay for this, and to make sure that 98 percent of all Americans will still get a tax cut, we will close corporate loopholes, cut government waste, and roll back only the Bush tax cuts for individuals who make more than $200,000 a year. Those Americans will go back to paying the same taxes you paid when Bill Clinton was president. And the rest of America will get a tax cut. With lower health care costs, better education, and a return to fiscal discipline – we'll all be stronger.\nThis can be our future.\nBut first we must choose. Our plan offers a new choice on health care. We can continue to reward HMOs, drug companies, and insurance companies with windfall profits, or we can fight for the middle-class with my plan to make health care affordable and available for all Americans.\nWe choose health care that works for all Americans – that lowers the cost to businesses, lowers the premiums for families, and makes health care affordable and accessible to everyone.\nFirst, we will take the waste and the greed out of the system to bring down the cost of health care for families and make our businesses more competitive.\nSecond, we'll make sure you get to pick your own doctor, and doctors and patients – not insurance company bureaucrats – will make medical decisions. Something that John Edwards has fought to get through Congress and this president has blocked.\nThird, we will save families up to $1,000 a year on their premiums by picking up the tab for the most expensive health care cases.\nFourth, we'll cover 95% of all Americans by allowing families and small businesses to buy into the same health care plan that members of Congress give themselves and providing tax breaks to make health care more affordable.\nFifth, we will allow Americans to buy more affordable prescription drugs from Canada. And finally, our plan will cover every single child in the United States of America.\nThis can be our future.\nBut first we must choose. Our plan offers a new choice on energy. We can continue to reward the oil companies and shipping billions of dollars overseas, or we can fight for the middle-class with my plan to finally make America energy independent of Mideast oil.\nWe choose an Energy Independent America.\nFirst, we will invest in technology and in the cars and SUVs you only have to fill up once a month, not every week.\nSecond, we'll give automakers tax credits up to $5000 for the fuel-efficient cars of the future so they can afford to produce these vehicles, and we'll give consumers tax credits so they can afford to buy them.\nAnd finally, we will also make sure that alternative energy sources will account for 20% of our fuel and 20% of our electricity by 2020\nI want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation, not the Saudi Royal Family.\nAnd that's why we're going to invest in technology and the vehicles of the future, so that no young American will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East. This can be our future. But first we must choose.\nWe already know what four more years of a Bush administration will look like. Every choice they've made has been to give more to those with the most, while telling everyone else you're on your own. That's their view and that's their plan for the next four years.\nBut it isn't ours. And it doesn't have to be our future. In thirty days, we have the chance to change all this. You can have a President whose got your back so we can bring back jobs, bring back opportunity, and bring back the promise that has kept hope in the hearts of the American people for generations. This is our new choice for the great middle-class and all those struggling to join it. And this can be our future.\nThank you, God Bless you, and God Bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-10-02", "title": "Remarks in Orlando, Florida"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29736", "text": "May the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, Oh Lord, my rock and my redeemer...\nThank you, Rev. Moss for that gracious introduction. And I want to thank Rev. Charles Bowie and the East Mt. Zion church family for giving me this opportunity to talk with you about the stakes in this election and the importance of every vote.\nFirst, I want to say that say that America would be a much better place if all Americans followed your example of faith and service to our people. Everyday, as you feed the hungry, clothe the naked and nourish the soul of our nation, you are turning faith into deeds and making a difference in the lives of thousands of people in this city and throughout this state. Some people want to take credit for the faith-based service that you've been doing for years. They want to turn it into a political issue. But we know that you've been working in partnership with government and community-based organizations for years to bring hope to communities across this state.\nYour dedication and your service live out the teaching of the Scripture: \"It is not enough, my brother, to say you have faith, when there are no deeds...Faith without works is dead.\" As you know, my friends, we are taught to walk by faith not by sight.\nAnd when we look around us – when we look around neighborhoods and towns and cities all across this country, we see faith to be lived out, and so many deeds to be done.\nAs it's said, faith is the substance of things hoped for, evidence of things not seen. [Hebrews 11:1] And we all know, you can't separate faith from substance.\nWe see jobs to be created. We see families to house. We see violence to stop. We see children to teach – and children to care for. We see too many people without health care and too many people of color suffering and dying from diseases like AIDS and cancer and diabetes.\nWe look at what is happening in America today and we forget to ask: Where are the deeds? Where is the substance in our faith?\nFifty years ago, with the decision in Brown v. the Board of Education, this nation had a great moment of conscience. A moment when we finally acknowledged God's truth that we are each made in His image and likeness – that separate but equal is not just unequal – but immoral.\n140 years after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, it is time to again emancipate this land, to live up to our ideals; it is time for a new moment of conscience in America.\nMore than anything else, this election is about basic American values. Our families. Our faith. Our love of country. And not just more talk, but about what we believe in our souls and who we're willing to fight for.\nThe fact is, the wrong choices of the Bush Administration are taking us back to two Americas -- separate and unequal. Again, where are the deeds? Where is the substance in our faith?\nFour years ago, George Bush came to office calling himself a \"compassionate conservative.\"\nWell, in the story of the Good Samaritan we are told of two men who pass by or cross to the other side of the street when they come upon a robbed and beaten man. They felt compassion, but there were no deeds. Then the Good Samaritan gave both his heart and his help. [Luke 10]\nIt is clear: For four years, George W. Bush may have talked about compassion, but he's walked right by. He's seen people in need, but he's crossed over to the other side of the street.\nSo let me ask you: Can America afford four more years of George W. Bush?\nTime and time again, this president has chosen the powerful and well-connected over hard-working middle class families and those who are struggling to join the middle class. That's his choice. But it's not ours.\nIn the biggest wrong choice of all, George Bush chose to go it alone in Iraq, shifting our focus and forces from the war on terror and those responsible for 9-11. And we're paying the price.\nAlmost all the casualties are the sons and daughters of America. And 90 percent of the costs are being met by Americans – the total so far: $200 billion and rising every day. That's $200 billion we're not investing in health care and education That's $200 billion we're not investing to make sure no child is left behind. That's $200 billion we're not investing in incentives to create and keep good jobs in the United States of America. That's $200 billion we're not investing in homeland security to keep cops on the street, to protect our airports, our subways, our bridges and tunnels. Do we want four more years of that?\nGeorge Bush's wrong choices for our economy have also been catastrophic. He chose tax cuts for billionaires and tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas. And we're paying the price: 1.6 million lost jobs – 237,000 right here in Ohio -- families earning $1,500 less, deficits as far as the eye can see. African-American unemployment at nearly 10 percent – double the rate for whites. That's more than a twenty-five percent increase since George Bush took office. Do we want four more years of that?\nMy friends, the promise of a better America is not being met when nearly one in three African American children are living in poverty. My friends, that's downright immoral – and I'm not going to stand for that.\nAs President, I will set a new direction. We're going to close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas. We're going to reward companies that create and keep good jobs here in America. And we are going to do more to expand homeownership and bring hope and jobs and businesses back to our hardest-pressed urban and metropolitan areas.\nBut that's not all. George W. Bush believes when it comes to health care, the HMO's come first and you come last. And we're paying the price – 45 million Americans without health insurance, including 400,000 more African Americans in the last four years. Premiums up $3,600. Medicare costs up 54 percent. And the cost of prescription drugs through the roof. Do we want four more years of that?\nAs President, I will set a new direction. My health care plan puts you and your families first. Our plan will take on the waste and greed in the health care system and save the average family up to $1,000 a year on their premiums. And with our plan – on day one -- every child in America will be covered. When I am president, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected, it is a right for all Americans.\nWhen it comes to education, George Bush has been demanding accountability from everybody except his own administration. We know that you can't really get the job done in our classrooms when too many children, especially children of color, are forced to attend overcrowded and crumbling schools and are being taught by overworked and underpaid teachers. The promise of a better America is not being met, when, fifty years after Brown, in too many parts of our country we still have two school systems – separate and unequal.\nAs President, I will set a new direction. We know the answer to closing the achievement gap is both higher expectations and greater resources. You cannot promise to leave no child behind and then leave the money behind. John Edwards and I have a plan to invest in our future, provide the needed funding and put a good teacher in every classroom – so that all our children will have the chance to develop their God-given potential.\nYou know, when I was a prosecutor, I sent criminals to jail for murder and rape for the rest of their lives. But I also spent a lot of time talking to kids in trouble. There wasn't one of those kids I met who didn't come from a place of neglect, a background of abuse, poverty or violence. They are where they are because adults weren't able – or just weren't doing – what they should have been. We can't be a nation that abandons our children. Our promise will never be met until we stop being a nation content to spend $50,000 a year to keep a young person in prison for the rest of their life, when we could invest $10,000 to give them Head Start, Early Start, Smart Start, the best possible start in life.\nThere is another fundamental choice in this election. My friends, we are hearing the same things you are hearing. What they did in Florida in 2000, they are in the process of doing in battleground states all across this country this year. Let me make one thing clear: We're not going to stand by and allow African American votes to go uncounted in this election. We're not going to stand by and allow acts of voter suppression.\nThey are trying to take your vote away because they know what we know -- without you we cannot prevail. With you and the true strength of your numbers, the strength of your community, we will prevail and take America in a new direction. And we are turning faith into deeds to make sure that happens.\nIn fact, on Tuesday, my campaign is holding a press conference in Washington to announce the formation of a team of nationally prominent lawyers – both black and white – working for us, who will make sure that this time we deliver on the promise to protect every vote and to fight against anyone who tries to deny that right. We are going to make sure that this time every vote is counted and every vote counts. And we need your help.\nThe other day, after a rally in Ohio, a woman asked someone from our campaign to deliver a message to me. She said, \"Senator Kerry, we've got your back.\"\nToday, I've got a message for that woman and every American working build a better life for their family: \"I've got your back, too.\"\nI've got your back because I know what you're going through. For the last four years, George Bush has turned his back on you and your families with almost every choice he's made. Four more years of Bush choices is four more years we just can't afford.\nYou deserve a new choice. And one month from today, you'll have one. You can have a President whose got your back so we can bring back jobs, bring back opportunity, and bring back the promise that has kept hope in the hearts of the American people for generations.\nOne month from today, the American Dream is on the ballot. Together, we can fulfill that dream.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2004-10-03", "title": "Remarks at East Mt.

{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29737", "text": "Thank you, Governor Richardson for that great introduction. America may be in the grips of an energy crisis, but with Governor Richardson at the helm, there is no shortage of energy or enthusiasm here in New Mexico.\nBefore we begin, let me say a few words about the loss of a man who was truly America's hero – my friend, Christopher Reeve. Teresa and I were deeply saddened to learn of his death, and we send our prayers to his loving wife Dana, his children, and his entire family. Chris was an inspiration to all of us. Without leaving his wheelchair, he was able to make great strides toward a cure for conditions like his. His tireless efforts will always be remembered and honored – and in part because of his work, millions will one day walk again. As Chris once said, \"So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.\" I know that one day we will realize Chris' inevitable dream.\nFor 60 years, New Mexico has been at the leading edge of change and innovation. In a very real sense, we won World War II right here in this state. In the summer of 1942, with the scars of Pearl Harbor still fresh, Americans were gearing up for battle. Yes, planes and tanks had to be built at a record pace, strategies conceived, battles planned, and young Americans dispatched to frontlines around the globe. But Franklin Roosevelt knew that we needed something more. He knew we had to marshal America's most brilliant minds and best technology. The initiative he created was called the Manhattan Project, and it was headquartered at Los Alamos.\nToday, we have an equally important challenge: to make America energy independent in the 21st century. Only then can we grow our economy as we should, protect our environment as we must, and keep our country as safe as it can be.\nTo do this, we need a president who will lead us there. We need a president who believes in America's great potential – and who believes that the middle class is America's greatest strength. We need a president who can see the problems facing America, and who will make the right choices to solve them.\nBut in the past four years, in nearly every decision he's made, George W. Bush has chosen the powerful and well-connected over middle class Americans.\nThe only people George Bush's policies are working for are the people he's chosen to help. They're working for drug companies. They're working for HMOs. And they're certainly working for the big oil companies.\nThe results are clear: 1.6 million private sector jobs have been lost. The cost of health care is up 64 percent. College tuition is up more than 35 percent. And the typical family is making $1,500 less each year -- while the cost of nearly everything continues to rise.\nRight now, oil prices are at an all-time high, with no end in sight. In most parts of the country, a gallon of gas costs nearly $2 – up 30 percent since George Bush took office. In the last four years, the cost of heating the average home with heating oil has gone up 91 percent. And high energy costs have pushed up prices across the board – from the food you put on your table to the clothes your children wear.\nA thirty percent increase in gas prices means a lot more profit for this President's friends in the oil industry. But for most middle class Americans, the Bush gas tax is a tax increase they can't afford. The funny thing is, George Bush is trying to scare you into thinking that I'm going to raise your taxes. But to borrow a saying, when it comes to George Bush's record on gas prices, he can run but he can't hide. Facts are stubborn things, Mr. President.\nFour years ago, when he was running for president, George Bush said, \"What I think the president ought to do is ... get on the phone with the OPEC cartel and say, we expect you to open your spigots!\" Today, four years later, with gas prices at record levels, we're still waiting for George Bush to make that phone call! The spigot is nearly shut – his energy policy has failed – and middle class families pay the price every time they fill up the gas tank.\nInstead of standing up for you, George Bush has chosen secret meetings with the energy industry behind closed doors in the White House, where they can make their case, but there's no one there to make yours. And then the president when all the way to the Supreme Court to protect the identity of his secret energy advisors.\nAnd after four years of empty rhetoric and inaction, the Republican-controlled Congress is ending another session without passing a good energy bill for America. At the end of the day, George Bush just couldn't get it done. Just like with jobs, health care, and education, the President has more excuses than results.\nYear after year, President Bush has proposed budgets that shortchange investments in clean, renewable, domestic sources of energy -- like wind, solar, and biomass. He ignores energy conservation. When it comes to developing a real energy policy, George Bush has run out of gas.\nJust like on every other issue, they'll tell you they have an energy plan. But as usual, it's a plan that warms the hearts of their powerful friends and leaves you out in the cold.\nTheir plan includes tax breaks totaling nearly $15 billion for George Bush's friends in the oil and gas industries. The president's plan, not surprisingly, provides sweetheart deals for Halliburton – including an exemption from the Safe Drinking Water Act so they can do more drilling. It's no wonder Senator John McCain has called the Bush bill the \"No lobbyist left behind act.\"\nWhat's worse, the Administration's own economists have found that their energy plan won't reduce gas prices or reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. In fact, the Bush energy policy hurts other businesses and slows economic growth. For example, the airline industry will spend an extra $11.4 billion on fuel this year. Truckers will spend an additional $15.6 billion. And farmers will spend an additional $2.8 billion. Even the Chairman of the President Council of Economic Advisors admitted recently, \"High energy prices are now a drag on the economy.\"\nHigher gas prices have cost the American consumer $34 billion since George Bush took office. But guess who's profiting from all this? That's right -- the people who wrote the energy plan in the first place – the big oil companies. The money you're paying at the pump is going directly from your wallets straight into the hands of oil companies and oil producers. Over the past three years, the big three oil companies have earned a record $38.6 billion in profits.\nThe Bush plan also threatens the environment by exempting all oil and gas drilling sites from parts of the Clean Water Act. It blocks efforts by 28 states to get oil companies to clean up polluted drinking water – and it saddles taxpayers with an $8 billion cleanup bill. And it opens sensitive wildlife habitats like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Otero Mesa here in your backyard to big oil and gas drillers.\nWorst of all, George Bush's plan does nothing to reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil.\nToday, we are importing 2.5 million barrels of oil from the Middle East every single day. In the last four years, the amount of foreign oil we consume has risen to sixty-one percent. When they went to war, this Administration's energy experts projected that oil would be as low as $28 a barrel today. Last week, gas prices hit a record $53 a barrel – and one big reason is because of this president's gross mismanagement of the war in Iraq.\nAs president, I have a real energy plan to harness the full force of America's technology and make this nation independent of Middle East oil in ten years. My plan will increase fuel efficiency, lower energy prices, produce alternative and renewable sources of energy, and create new jobs here at home. I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation, not the Saudi Royal family.\nMy five-point plan will make America safer, stronger and more secure.\nFirst, as President, I will speed up investment in technologies that save energy and create alternative fuels. Through a new Energy Security and Conservation Trust Fund, Americans will have a guaranteed commitment to reducing our dependence on oil. We only have three percent of the world's oil reserves. There is no way for us to drill our way out of this crisis. We have to invent our way out of it. American creativity has to drive the process – and new American jobs, good jobs here at home, will be our reward.\nToday, the funding for our energy security is sporadic, uncertain, and insufficient. We may not have the greatest oil reserves on Earth, but we do have great resources of intellect and invention to find new fuels and to conserve and optimize traditional ones. So the trust fund I propose will take existing royalties that corporations now pay for the right to drill on public lands and dedicate that money to Research and Development so that we can have cleaner and more abundant energy sources.\nWe know that the road to more energy independence depends on making our cars and trucks more energy efficient. One out of every seven barrels of oil in the world is consumed on America's highways. That's why my plan contains economic incentives to build the energy-efficient cars, trucks, SUVs, and buses of the future. And I am determined that by the year 2020, 20 percent of America's energy will come from domestically produced alternative fuels like ethanol.\nSecond, my plan reduces energy bills for American consumers. Under the Bush Administration, many Americans will be spending $500 more this winter to heat their homes. My plan will rein in out-of-control gas prices for families, farmers and businesses by restoring American leadership abroad, simplifying gasoline rules, deploying our Strategic Petroleum Reserve when appropriate, ensuring fair competition in the energy marketplace and helping industry, schools and homes increase energy efficiency and cut their energy bills. To begin with, my administration will enact efficiency standards to cut the federal energy bill by 20% -- saving $2 billion a year. We will help states, municipalities, businesses, and consumers do the same.\nThird, we will diversify sources of energy. For four years, this administration has sat by while our dependence on foreign oil has increased. My plan will focus on finding new sources of energy. We will make clean coal a real part of our energy future. We will ensure that by the year 2020, twenty percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources like wind and solar. We will seek new sources of oil in non-OPEC countries. We will increase the supply of natural gas by developing domestic natural gas sources that are already open for leasing and drilling. And we will enhance our ability to move natural gas from Alaska and Canada.\nFourth, our energy grid is vulnerable; it can and must be strengthened. The August 14, 2003 blackout resulted in the loss of electricity for more than 50 million people and cost our economy $6 billion. The footprint of the blackout on both sides of the US-Canadian border included great urban areas that are heavily industrialized and important financial centers. More than a year after the August 14th blackout, George Bush hasn't taken any action to ensure that the lights don't go out again. We will.\nFifth, we will create 500,000 new clean energy jobs in America by providing incentives to invest in clean energy technologies and encourage job creation. Here in New Mexico, in places like the new wind farm in Quay County, you've seen how investments in renewable energy protect the environment while they also produce new jobs.\nAmerica once led the world in the production of clean energy products and the payrolls that go with them. We have to do it again – whether it's in wind or biomass, solar or clean coal.\nMy friends, sixty years after the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos, Sandia and all our national laboratories continue to push the boundaries of knowledge. You can continue to strengthen our national security if we invest in your capacity to safeguard our environment and make America independent of Mideast oil. You understand that what's good for the earth is good for the people, good for our economy and good for a safer and stronger America. And you are leading with a uniquely American question: What if?\nSo much promise stretches before us. America needs to climb the next mountain, look to the next horizon, and ask: What if?\nFor the sake of our children...for the sake of our security ... for the sake of our economy ... for the sake of our environment ... we must meet that challenge and make America energy independent of Mideast oil.\nWhat if we do that? I know we can. We just have to believe in ourselves. Let's start making it happen twenty-two days from now!\nThank you and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-10-11", "title": "Remarks in Santa Fe, New Mexico"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29738", "text": "Thank you. So did anyone catch the debate last night? I think it went pretty well – I just hope I covered the Vegas odds.\nIt's great to be here with you at the AARP's National Event. I'm a proud member of your organization – but I hope you won't mind if I hold off on retirement for a few more years. There's this one last job I'm hoping to start in January.\nMy friends, after three debates, two conventions, and months of campaigning, today we stand at a moment of great possibility and great hope.\nSixty years ago, Franklin Roosevelt used such a moment to launch the greatest expansion of the middle class in history with the GI Bill of Rights. And when many of our parents – and some of you – returned from World War II, America was a place where you had the chance to go to college, find a good job, buy your own home, and provide your children with the best opportunities in life.\nTwenty years later, Lyndon Johnson used a similar moment to ensure that a lifetime of hard work was rewarded with a retirement that included health care. And because Americans like AARP founder Ethel Percy Andrus fought for Medicare, the middle-class was strengthened once again.\nAnd in the last decade, Bill Clinton seized the moment by restoring an economy that put people first. We created 23 million jobs, lifted 6 million Americans out of poverty, and the average family made $5000 more.\nNow it is our moment – our moment to choose what kind of future we want for ourselves and our children and our grandchildren. Do we want four more years of a President who gives more to those with the most and tells a struggling middle-class that everything's just fine? Or do we want a President who will honor middle-class values and fight for middle-class opportunities? Do we want a President who fights for the privileged few or do we want a President who fights for a stronger America for every American?\nI believe we need a fresh start in America. I believe we need a President who will fight for the great middle-class and those struggling to join it. And if you give me the chance, I am ready to be that President.\nWe need a fresh start. Because the truth is, middle-class families can't afford another four years of the Bush economy.\nToo many jobs are being shipped overseas, and the ones that replace them often don't pay enough to make ends meet. Our economy is losing high-paying, middle-class jobs and creating more temporary jobs and part-time jobs without benefits. Corporate profits are up, but family income is down, and the cost of everything is through the roof. Health care up 64 percent. College tuition up 35 percent. Medicare premiums up 56 percent. 1.6 million lost jobs, 5 million more Americans without health care, and 220,000 students who couldn't afford college.\nBut these aren't just statistics – these are the stories of families I've met all across America. The single mother who lies awake worrying that her child's health care might cost more than she makes in a month. Moms and dads who save and save and still come up short when they get a bill for tuition or child care that's higher than they thought. The factory worker whose job was sent overseas and now has to take two jobs just to earn what he used to make.\nEverywhere I go, I hear the same concerns. Will I be able to send my kid to college? Will I be able to pay my wife's medical bill? Will Social Security be there for me when I retire? Will my job be there tomorrow? Folks tell me how hard it is just to get by – never mind getting ahead.\nGeorge Bush had four years to do something – anything – to make life better for hardworking families. But instead of seizing the moment, he squandered the opportunity. Then he spent his entire campaign trying to make us believe the unbelievable.\nJobs got shipped overseas, and the Bush White House told us outsourcing is good for us.\nGeorge Bush became the first President in 72 years -- since Herbert Hoover – to lose jobs on his watch, and they told us it was time to celebrate.\nFamilies got squeezed between prices that are rising and incomes that are falling, they told us hey, don't worry, this is the best economy of our lifetime! And just the other day, the President's Treasury Secretary, his top economic advisor, told us that 1.6 million lost private sector jobs is just a \"myth.\" Mr. President, the millions of Americans who have lost jobs on your watch are not \"myths,\" they are middle class families – and for four years, you've turned your back on them.\nThe President just doesn't get it. He can spin until he's dizzy, but at the end of the day, who does he think the American people are going to believe? George Bush or their own eyes?\nYou know, the President was right across town today – of course, he didn't come by to see you. Instead, he launched another false attack on me and he finished it up by saying again, \"you can run but you can't hide.\"\nWell, that line comes from the boxer Joe Louis. And it makes me think of another boxing quote: what Muhammad Ali said to George Foreman, after Foreman had thrown some punches. Ali said, \"Is that all you got?\"\nAnd so, I say to you, Mr. President: after four years of jobs lost, families losing health coverage, and falling incomes, \"Is that all you got?\" After four years of rising gas prices, rising health care costs, and squeezed families, \"Is that all you got?\" After a campaign filled with excuses to justify your record and false attacks on mine, \"Is that all you got?\"\nThe reason the President doesn't get it is because for the powerful and well-connected friends he's spent four years helping, it really is the best economy of their lifetime. When he handed Halliburton a $7 billion no-bid contract, they really did have reason to celebrate. When he gave tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas, it really was good for them. And when his Medicare bill gave the prescription drug companies a $139 billion in windfall profits, well, it doesn't get much better than that.\nNow I know that this last issue is one where the AARP and I have disagreed. But I can't just come here and not tell you the truth. George Bush's Medicare bill is full of empty promises and special interest giveaways, and it's a perfect example of what I've been talking about. The AARP tried to work with the President, but in the end, the President was not working for America's seniors. And maybe that's why he wouldn't even show up today to defend his bill.\nToday, the costs of prescription drugs are skyrocketing. Co-payments are up 50%, and all across America, seniors are being forced to choose between their meals and their medicine.\nGeorge Bush had a chance to do something about this. But instead, he jammed through a Medicare bill that takes $550 billion from your pockets and gives $139 billion to the drug companies and billions more to HMOs. It's a bill that will actually raise costs on seniors, force them into HMOs, and put 3.8 million at risk of losing their drug coverage altogether.\nBut it gets worse. As I mentioned in the debate last night, George Bush has even made it illegal for our own government to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices. And for four years, he's been blocking the importation of cheaper drugs from Canada. Of course, last night the President said he was hoping to make up the shortage of flu vaccinations by importing them from Canada. And if there still aren't enough flu vaccinations, what's the President's solution? He says, don't get one if you're healthy. Sounds just like his health care plan: hope you don't get sick.\nNow they're offering you a so-called discount drug card that's only adding to the confusion and barley doing anything to cut the cost of your prescription drugs. In fact, a study by your own organization even found that some drug companies are raising the prices of medicine to make it appear like you're getting a real discount. That's not the kind of relief Americans need.\nThe truth is, after doing nothing to lower the cost of prescription drugs for you, the President now tells us that he's solved the problem. Right. And those weapons of mass destruction are gonna turn up any day now.\nThe problem is, unless we have a fresh start in America, George Bush will do the same thing with Social Security. We've seen the past, so we should not be fooled about the future. On this, the AARP and I are standing and fighting together.\nAt his Republican convention, George Bush said that one of his major priorities is to privatize Social Security. And no matter what he says now, the truth is in his plan: it's a plan to privatize, and it's a plan that will cut your benefits. And all three options laid out by his own commission say that very same thing. That's not a plan – it's a rip-off, and it will never happen when I am President. No matter which way you slice it, the Congressional Budget Office reports that George Bush's scheme would cut benefits from 23 percent up to 45 percent and cost taxpayers $2 trillion. And yet, big brokerage houses that manage the private Social Security accounts would stand to gain $940 billion in windfall profits.\n$940 billion for the powerful and well-connected – lower benefits and a higher tax bill for you. If George Bush doesn't get what's wrong with that, he'll never get it.\nIf George Bush can't see how shifting the tax burden from the wealthiest to the middle-class hurts folks struggling to get by, he never will. If he can't understand why rewarding companies that send jobs overseas hurts our economy, he'll never stop it. And if he can't understand why the last four years have been so hard on middle-class families, he's bound to give us another four that are just as tough.\nThe President has proven beyond a doubt that he's out of touch, out of ideas, and unwilling to change course.\nThe good news is, in just nineteen days, we can leave it all behind.\nMy friends, George Bush's time is up. Our moment is now. Our future is hopeful. And we're ready for a fresh start in America.\nWe will seize this moment to bring back hope for millions of hardworking Americans who believe in their hearts that tomorrow can be better than today. We will create the jobs of the future, lift up families of all generations, and give our children the best possible chance in life. And we will restore an America with a strong middle-class where everyone has the chance to work and the opportunity to get ahead.\nI know that John Edwards and I have talked a lot about fighting for the middle-class during this campaign, but here is exactly how we plan to make our future work for all of us:\nFirst, we will end the days of rewarding companies for shipping jobs overseas by offering a fresh start on jobs in America. Our plan will create good jobs with decent benefits that pay more so you can keep up with the bills. We'll do this by closing the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas. And we'll take that money and reward companies that create and keep good jobs here in the United States of America. We'll help American business grow by cutting the corporate tax rate by five percent, giving 99 percent of businesses a tax break. And we'll provide a New Jobs Tax Credit for every small business and manufacturer who decide to add more employees to the payroll.\nWe will have a new trade policy that stands up for American workers and opens markets at the same time. Unlike this Administration, I will enforce our trade deals, because I know that if you give the American worker a fair playing field to compete on, there's nobody in the world the American worker can't compete against.\nAnd we will create the high-tech, high-wage jobs of the future by investing more in our people and their ideas. As president, I will push the boundaries of science, and never let ideology get in the way of life-saving research or cutting-edge technology, like stem cell research. When I'm president, I will lift the ban on federal funding on stem cell research – a ban that's tied the hands of our scientists and shut down some of our most promising work on spinal cord injuries, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and other life threatening diseases.\nWe will offer tax credits to help us seize the possibilities of the Broadband Revolution and make Internet access available to all of America's families. And we will give our workers the education and the job training that the jobs of tomorrow require today.\nSecond, we will end the days of tax giveaways for the wealthy at the expense of tax breaks for the middle-class by offering a fresh start on taxes in America. Our plan will provide middle-class tax cuts that bring down the biggest costs facing parents -- so they can get ahead and spend more time with their children. We'll help parents cover the rising costs of child care by offering a tax credit of $1,000. We'll give more young Americans the chance to go to college by offering a tax break on up to $4,000 in tuition for four years of college. And to pay for this, and to make sure that 98 percent of all Americans will still get a tax cut, we will close corporate loopholes, cut government waste, and roll back only the Bush tax cuts for individuals who make more than $200,000 a year. Those Americans will go back to paying the same taxes you paid when Bill Clinton was president. The rest of America will get a tax cut.\nThird, we will end the days of skyrocketing health care costs and drug company giveaways by offering a fresh start on health care in America. Our plan will finally make health care affordable and available to all Americans.\nWe'll start by getting costs down for families. That means cutting prescription drug prices by finally allowing the re-importation of safe drugs from Canada. It means making it easier to get generic drugs to the market – and having an Attorney General that will enforce our patent laws, so our seniors can get less expensive drugs. And it means doing what this President has refused to do for four years – allowing our own Medicare program to negotiate with the drug companies to get lower prices for seniors.\nWe'll also give everyone the chance to buy affordable health insurance by allow families and small businesses to buy into the same health care plan that members of Congress give themselves. We'll cover every child in America by letting their parents sign them up for health insurance right at their own school. And we'll finally pass a Patients Bill of Rights to make sure that doctors and patients – not insurance company bureaucrats – will make medical decisions.\nFourth, we will leave behind an energy policy of big oil, by big oil, and for big oil by offering a fresh start on energy independence in America. Our plan will finally make America energy independent of Mideast oil in ten years.\nWe'll invest in technology and in the cars and SUVs you only have to fill up once a month, not every week. We'll give automakers tax credits up to $5000 for the fuel-efficient cars of the future so they can afford to produce these vehicles, and we'll give consumers tax credits so they can afford to buy them. And finally, we will also make sure that alternative energy sources will account for 20% of our fuel and 20% of our electricity by 2020\nI want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation, not the Saudi Royal Family.\nFinally, together with AARP, we will say no to the privatization of Social Security. Our plan will strengthen Social Security, not undermine it. The first step to saving Social Security is getting our fiscal house in order. As president, I will make the tough choices, take on the special interests, and put our country back on the path to fiscal discipline. But I pledge this: I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. I will not raise the retirement age. Because when you've worked for a lifetime, America owes you what you've earned.\nAfter four years of a President who always gave the powerful and well-connected a handout instead of giving middle-class families a hand-up, I believe America is ready for a fresh start. I believe we're ready to leave the failed policies of the past behind, and look toward the future with the hope that America can once again be the land of opportunity for every American.\nMy friends, this isn't about being a Democrat or a Republican. It's about what it means to be American. It's about the American dream. The dream of mothers and fathers who wake up every morning determined to build a better life for their children and their grandchildren – and go to bed every night praying that they'll be safe and that our nation will be strong. It's about the American dream of liberty and justice for all – and the hope and optimism that says America can always do better. We just need to come together as One America and believe in ourselves. We can bring back that mighty dream. And, with your help, we will.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2004-10-14", "title": "Remarks to the National Conference of the American Association of Retired People in Las Vegas"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29739", "text": "It's great to be here today with all of you at Milwaukee Area Technical College. Every day, this school brings the American dream to life, opening the doors of opportunity to so many hard-working, ambitious students.\nAnd today, at a school devoted to preparing students for the jobs of the twenty-first century, it's fitting that I'm here to discuss what we must do to create the economy of the twenty-first century. An economy where the American Dream will once again become a reality for middle class families.\nRight now, we've got an economy where, for too many people, the American Dream is harder and harder to reach. In just the past four years, we've lost 1.6 million private sector jobs – 67,500 manufacturing jobs right here in Wisconsin. Our opponents suggest telling the truth about the challenges we face is pessimistic. Well, I think the most pessimistic thing you can say is that America can't do better.\nJob loss – which they proclaim is a myth – is just the beginning of the problem.\nWe know that the strength of our economy isn't just about how many jobs we've gained or lost. It's also about whether those jobs lift up our families. It's about whether our incomes are rising or falling. It's about whether people can buy a home, afford good health care, send their kids to college, and enjoy a comfortable retirement after a lifetime of hard work.\nThe truth is that right now, too many of them can't. The jobs we're creating today pay $9,000 less than the ones we've lost. Many are part-time or temporary, and many don't provide health care or benefits.\nSo today, even two incomes barely cover the basics. Health care costs are up 64%. College tuition up 35%. Gas prices up 30%. All while family incomes have fallen by $1,500. As President Reagan said, \"Facts are stubborn things.\"\nRight now, we've got an economy where people feel like they're on a treadmill, running faster and faster with each passing year. But they're not getting ahead. They're staying in place – and they're falling behind.\nThe bottom line: this economy has a bad case of the flu – and it a needs a dose of new medicine.\nGeorge Bush has had four years to do something – anything – to create an economy where hard working Americans can live out their dreams. But instead of seizing the moment, he squandered the opportunity. The problem is, this President either just doesn't understand what's happened to our economy or he understands and doesn't care.\nJobs are being shipped overseas – and his Administration says outsourcing is good for us. He's the first president to lose jobs in 72 years – and they say it's time to celebrate. The first president in 11 presidents to lose jobs on his watch. Wages are falling, costs are rising – and they tell us, hey, don't worry, this is the best economy of our lifetime! The first president in 70 years to see family income decline every year of his presidency.\nRemarkably, the President said he was proud of his record. Proud of his record? Proud of millions of Americans unemployed ... proud of tens of millions without health insurance ... proud of millions of families facing rising costs and falling incomes? And this on the day the federal government announced the largest deficit in American history. If that's what he's proud of, I'd hate to see what he's ashamed of.\nAnd just last week, Bush's Secretary of Commerce said – and I quote – \"I just don't accept that conclusion that we've lost jobs during this administration.\" This week, his Treasury Secretary claimed that the job losses are nothing but a \"myth.\" Mr. President, the millions of Americans who have lost jobs on your watch are not \"myths,\" they are middle class families – and for four years, you've turned your back on them. With comments like that, we can stop guessing which mistakes the president was referring to the other day when he was talking about his appointments.\nThe President has proven beyond a doubt that he's out of touch, out of ideas, and unwilling to change course. He can spin until he's dizzy, but at the end of the day, who does he think the American people are going to believe – George Bush or their own eyes?\nThe reason the President doesn't talk about the real challenges is because for the wealthy and well-connected, it really is the best economy of their lifetime. When he handed Halliburton a $7 billion no-bid contract, they really did have reason to celebrate. When he gave tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas, it really was good for them. And when his Medicare bill gave the prescription drug companies a $139 billion in windfall profits, well, it doesn't get much better than that.\nBut it doesn't have to be this way. On November 2nd, we have a choice. We can choose a President who understands the challenges our economy is facing – and has the vision and daring to meet them. A President who will create an economy where the doors of opportunity are once again open to our great middle class. If you give me the chance, I will be that President.\nI believe that we're ready for a fresh start in America. Because middle-class families simply can't afford four more years of the Bush economy. Because behind every statistic about lost jobs, behind every statistic about jobs that don't pay enough – there's a story.\nIt's the story of people like Ray Raschilla, who I met a couple of weeks ago. Ray's a steelworker who's been locked out of a job for almost a year. He's been looking hard for work, but when employers know he's in a lock out, it's hard to get hired.\nFor Ray, the most difficult moment came when his teenaged daughter told him she was going to her first homecoming. Ray asked her what she was going to do for a dress, and she looked at him and replied, \"Well, Dad, I know you're not working, so don't worry, Mom and Grandma took care of it.\" Ray told me, \"That was probably the toughest day of the last 12 months, because she knew I couldn't help her – and I knew I couldn't help her.\"\nI meet people like Ray every day – folks who have that feeling of powerlessness. The feeling that they haven't just lost a way to make a living, they've lost a way of life.\nAnd I meet people who've got jobs, but still aren't getting by. People who tell me, John, I'm working days, I'm working nights, I'm working weekends – isn't my family supposed to be doing better?\nThese folks are right on the edge as costs spiral beyond their control. For them, there's always that nagging sense that even if they've had their job for a year, or five years, or ten years – they don't know whether they'll still have it next week, or next month.\nAnd let's be clear: An economy like this doesn't just happen by itself. Whether people win or lose in our economy is not a matter of chance – it's a matter of choices.\nThink back to the 1990's, when we had a President with a vision of a new economy where the bright light of opportunity shone for all Americans. That President made the right choices, and the result was 23 million new jobs, incomes up $7,200, six million fewer people in poverty.\nGeorge W. Bush came into office with a very different philosophy. He made a different set of choices – and today, we see a very different set of results.\nNot once, not twice, but three times, he chose to give tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans – those who earn more than $200,000 a year. Tax cuts that would increase the burden on middle class families. George W. Bush promised that his economic plan would create 6 million new jobs. He was wrong – and we're now seven million jobs behind where he predicted we'd be.\nAnd then, when he had a chance to save American jobs, George Bush chose tax cuts that reward corporations for shipping jobs overseas – and he raised taxes on businesses that create jobs here at home.\nBut instead of talking about the real challenges facing America's middle class, all George Bush can do is launch more false attacks against me. Just yesterday, he finished his latest false charge by saying once again, \"you can run but you can't hide.\"\nWell as you may know, that line comes from the boxer Joe Louis. And it makes me think of another quote from another great boxer: what Muhammad Ali said to George Foreman, after Foreman had thrown some punches. Ali said, \"Is that all you got?\"\nMr. President, with the minimum wage the lowest it's been in nearly 50 years, denying 9.2 million women $3,800 a year, is that all you got? Mr. President, with health care costs skyrocketing, premiums up $3,500, and 5 million more Americans without health care on your watch, is that all you got?\nMr. President, with gasoline prices at record levels, with people emptying their wallets every time they fill up their tanks, is that all you got? Mr. President, with rising costs and falling incomes and middle class families squeezed like never before, is that all you got? After a campaign filled with excuses to justify your record and false attacks on mine, \"Is that all you got?\"\nWell, let me tell you what I got. I will raise the minimum wage, so millions of Americans don't have to live in poverty. I will bring down health care costs and strengthen the middle class. And I will make America energy independent of Mideast oil.\nIn the end, George Bush and I just have fundamentally different approaches to jobs and the economy. He thinks that we should give more to the most – and eventually, a little something will filter down to the middle class. He judges the success of our economy by the success of those at the top.\nI disagree. I believe that the success of our economy is about your success – it's about whether people who work hard every day can build a better life for their families. I believe that we should put middle class Americans first, and build an economy that lifts all Americans. And here's how I'm going to do it.\nFirst, we're going to focus on keeping and creating good jobs right here in America. We'll close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas – and we'll reward companies that create and keep good jobs here at home. We'll help American business grow by cutting the corporate tax rate by five percent, giving 99 percent of businesses a tax break. And we'll provide a New Jobs Tax Credit for every small business and manufacturer who decides to add more employees to the payroll.\nSecond, we'll offer middle-class tax cuts that help families shoulder their biggest costs. We'll give parents a tax credit of $1,000 to help pay for the rising costs of child care. And we'll offer a tax break on up to $4,000 in tuition for all four years of college to give more young Americans the chance to live our their dreams.\nThird, we'll provide immediate relief to middle class families who've been hit hard by soaring health care costs. We'll give a tax cut to every small business that provides quality health care for its workers. We'll help all businesses lower the costs of their health care plans. We'll fight to cut prescription drug costs. And we'll give every American access to same plan that members of Congress get.\nFinally, we'll invest in our people and their ideas to build the foundation of the high-tech, high-wage economy of the future. The fact is that today, times are changing more rapidly than ever before. And it's not enough to change with the times – we need to change ahead of the times.\nThat's why we're going to support research and development – because we know that the jobs of tomorrow depend on the discoveries of today. And we'll invest in the energy technology of the future – in innovations that will create good jobs across America. We'll give automakers tax credits up to $5,000 to create the fuel-efficient cars of the future, and we'll make sure that alternative energy sources will account for 20% of our fuel and 20% of our electricity by 2020. I believe it's high time we had an America that relied on its own ingenuity, innovation, and skilled workers – not the Saudi Royal Family.\nWe'll do all of this while cutting the deficit in half – and we won't raise taxes on middle class Americans by one dime. Instead, we'll pay for our plans by rolling back the Bush tax cuts on Americans making over $200,000, closing corporate loopholes, cutting wasteful spending, and reinstating the basic pay-as-you-go rules that every family lives by.\nWhen it comes to our economy, America is ready for a fresh start. I believe we're ready to leave the failed policies of the past behind, and look to the future with the hope that America can once again open the doors of opportunity to all.\nWe can get our economy moving again. We can make the tax code fair. We can raise the incomes of working Americans. We can make the economy work for everyone – not just those at the top. We need a president who understands the challenge and is committed to fighting for the middle class and those struggling to get into it.\nMy friends, in the end, this isn't about being a Democrat or a Republican. It's about what it means to be an American. It's about mothers and fathers who wake up every morning determined to build a better life for their children – and go to bed every night praying that they'll be safe and our nation will be strong. It's about the hope and optimism that says America can always do better. We're the country of the future – we're the can-do country. We just need to come together as one America and believe in ourselves. We can bring back our mighty dream. And, with your help, we will.\nThank you, and God bless America", "timestamp": "2004-10-15", "title": "Remarks at Milwaukee Area Technical College"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29740", "text": "Good morning, this is John Kerry.\nThis past week, America lost one of its heroes and my friend, Christopher Reeve. Chris was one of the most hopeful people I've ever met. He treated every single day like a gift, and his life was a gift to all of us. His courage, compassion, and determination were an inspiration – and I'm confident that because of his work, millions of Americans will ultimately live healthier lives.\nBut the fact is that right now, we're not doing everything we can to help Americans realize this dream. Three years ago, George W. Bush put in place a ban on federal funding for stem cell research – a ban that's tied the hands of our scientists and shut down some of our most promising work on spinal cord injuries, Alzheimer's, Diabetes, Parkinson's and other life-threatening diseases.\nToday, approximately 100 million Americans suffer from illnesses that may one day be treated or cured with stem-cell therapy. Stem cells may hold the key to treating heart disease and cancer. They may have the power to slow the loss of a grandmother's memory, calm the hand of an uncle with Parkinson's, or save a child from a lifetime of daily insulin shots.\nBy restricting stem cell research, President Bush has turned his back on this hope. He's made the wrong choice to sacrifice science for extreme right-wing ideology. And right now, there is such possibility for treatments that could transform our lives – but because of the stem cell ban, they are still beyond our reach.\nThat's not the American way. Here in America, we've always pushed the boundaries of knowledge and used the power of science to improve the lives of our people. The first car to roll off an assembly line was made right here in America. The first airplane took off from American soil. And the first footprints on the moon were left by an American astronaut. Now we stand at the edge of the next great frontier – but instead of leading the way, we're stuck on the sidelines.\nBut President Bush just doesn't get it. Faced with the facts, he turns away. Time and time again, he's proven that he's stubborn, out of touch, and unwilling to change course.\nLeaders from both political parties – including Senators Orrin Hatch from Utah and John McCain from Arizona – both support stem cell research as well as many others. And the majority of Americans do. But instead of listening to them, this Administration claims that supporting stem cell research creates false hope.\nThink about that for a minute. Imagine if we'd told researchers studying polio they were creating false hope. Imagine if we'd told those working to eradicate small pox they were creating false hope. It's unthinkable, isn't it? But that's exactly what this Administration is saying to scientists who want to study Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Diabetes, spinal cord injuries and so many other debilitating conditions.\nAnd that's just an honest difference of opinion between George Bush and me. I believe that when it comes to our most promising research – there's no such thing as false hope. I know that when we put our best minds to work studying our worst diseases – time and time again, we find treatments, and cures, and vaccines. But when we don't – when we have a President who dismisses our scientists and turns his back on science – then we say no to discovery, no to innovation, and no to hope for so many Americans\nWhen I'm President, we're going to stop saying no. We're going to say yes. We're going to lift the ban on federal funding for stem cell research once and for all. We're going to make funding for this research a top priority in our government agencies, our universities, and our medical community. And we'll continue to lead the world in great discoveries – all while upholding the highest ethical standards. That's the right choice for America.\nChristopher Reeve once remarked that \"So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.\" Together, we're going to fight to make Chris' impossible dream a beautiful reality. We're going to once again say yes to science, yes to discovery, and yes to a new era of hope for all Americans.\nThanks for listening.", "timestamp": "2004-10-16", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29741", "text": "It's great to be here with all of you at Xenia High School.\nFor the past two years, I've traveled across America meeting people just like you – people who love their families, love their country, and are determined to build a better life for their kids. But while they're working hard and doing everything right, they can't get ahead – they can barely even stay in place – because today's economy is leaving them behind.\nIn the past four years, we've lost 1.6 million private sector jobs. In Ohio alone we've lost 237,000 jobs – 173,000 of them in manufacturing. And the jobs we're creating today pay $9,000 less than the ones we've lost. So we're losing good jobs and replacing them with ones that don't pay the bills. And, as we learned just yesterday, consumer confidence is plunging as Americans become more and more worried about the state of our economy.\nAnd you know what the Bush Administration says to all this? Just this week, President Bush's Treasury Secretary, John Snow, came right here to Ohio – a state with some of the worst job losses in America – and stated that job losses are nothing but a \"myth.\" It's right here, on the front page of the Findlay Courier. Right next to a column about how many of our jobs pay so little that almost 39 million Americans – 20 million of them children – can barely afford things like food and housing.\nWell I've got a message for our president. Mr. President, the Americans who have lost jobs on your watch are not \"myths,\" they are middle class families – and for four years, you've turned your back on them. And on November 2nd, the workers I've met here in Ohio are going to show George Bush that they won't stand for being \"Snowed\" any more.\nGeorge Bush just doesn't get it. Jobs are being shipped overseas – and his Administration says outsourcing is good for us. He's the first president to lose jobs in 72 years – and they say it's time to celebrate. Wages are falling, costs are rising – and they tell us, hey, don't worry, this is the best economy of our lifetime!\nWhen it comes to reality, George Bush has a simple strategy: Ignore it, deny it, then try to hide it.\nWe see it in Iraq, where things are getting worse each week with more violence, more chaos, more killings. We've lost more than 1,000 brave men and women – and more than 7,000 have been wounded. But George Bush says we're making progress in Iraq.\nWe saw it with health care, when we learned that there was a severe shortage of flu vaccines this season. The story of how this happened is a troubling one.\nWay back in 2001, our government was warned that our system was vulnerable to vaccine shortages. That was a red flag.\nIn June 2003, US health regulators discovered quality control problems at one of the two factories that produces the flu vaccine. That was another red flag.\nThen, in August of this year, the manufacturer notified the Bush Administration that there were serious contamination problems in 6 to 8 million of their flu vaccines. That was yet another red flag.\nThen, in October of this year, British regulators suspended the company's license. And only then, finally, did we go in to inspect the factory. But it was too late. And now, because of this Administration's failure of leadership and judgment – because of their failure to act – we've got a shortfall of up to 48 million flu vaccines.\nSo what's happening with the flu vaccine is a perfect example of everything that's wrong with this President.\nThe production of the vaccine was sent to a factory overseas...sounds like George Bush's jobs plan.\nHe failed to adequately monitor the vaccine company, even after a year of warning signs that something was wrong, and even after years of warnings that we were vulnerable to shortages...sounds like his policy on Enron and Halliburton.\nNow he tells healthy Americans not to get their flu shots...sounds like his health care plan – pray you don't get sick.\nMillions of Americans – including seniors and children – won't be able to get a flu shot this year. We've got people standing in lines for hours on end – some of them in their seventies and eighties – hoping to be one of the lucky ones. And every day, our health care workers struggle to make what could be life or death decisions about who will get a shot.\nThen in the debate this past week, George Bush said \"We're working with Canada to...help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season.\" Well, I don't know about you, but I think that sure sounds odd coming from a President who's banned importing safe, effective, and affordable drugs from Canada. And the next day, Bush's own Secretary of Health even admitted that getting FDA approval in time for this year's flu season was \"doubtful.\"\nAnd believe it or not, just like with Iraq, just like with the economy, a top Bush Administration official is now saying that even with the benefit of hindsight, the Administration wouldn't have done anything differently.\nIt's just business as usual with George W. Bush: Ignore it, deny it, then try to hide it. And when confronted with a mistake, try and explain things away.\nWell that's not going to cut it. When I'm President, we're going to have a real strategy to deal with crises like these. My running mate, John Edwards, called for national leadership on this issue nearly a year ago. Back in December of 2003, he spoke out about the importance of having enough flu vaccine and having a good strategy for responding to outbreaks. And that's exactly what's we're going to provide. We'll take responsibility for this. We'll work with companies both here and abroad to make sure we've got a safety net – and we'll ensure that there are enough vaccines to keep our families healthy.\nAnd when it comes to jobs and our economy, in just 17 days, on November 2nd, we'll give America a fresh start. Because that's the day when things are going to change in America. That's the day when we're going to choose to put the middle class first, and build an economy that lifts all Americans.\nWe're going to create jobs. We'll do it by closing the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas – and rewarding companies that create and keep them here in the United States of America.\nWe're going to give middle class families tax relief to help them ease the squeeze between higher costs and lower wages. We'll give parents a $1,000 tax credit to help pay for child care. And we'll give young people a tax break on up to $4,000 in tuition for all four years of college.\nFinally, we'll help families afford quality health care by making it easier for businesses to insure their workers, by lowering prescription drug costs, and by giving every American access to the same plan that members of Congress get.\nToday, America is ready to leave the failed policies of the past behind, and look to the future with the hope and optimism that says that America can always do better. We just need to come together as one America and believe in ourselves. And with your help, we will.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America. And now I'd be happy to take some of your questions.", "timestamp": "2004-10-16", "title": "Remarks at Xenia High School in Xenia, Ohio"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=84925", "text": "Good afternoon and thank you. What a pleasure it is to be here with such a great group of women.\nEight years ago, I shared a platform with the author Jill Ker Conway, an Australian who was then president of Smith College and Susan Weld, whose husband, Governor Bill Weld, was then running against John Kerry for the Senate. The three of us were speaking at a benefit for the Pine Street Inn, a shelter that does excellent work with the homeless in Boston.\nIn preparing my remarks for that evening, I found a passage in Jill's book, The Road From Coorain, that reminded me of what Susan Weld and I were experiencing at the time. In it, Jill described herself and her mother as \"a tiny island of women in a world that revolved around male activities.\" Today that passage reminds me of what Laura Bush and I are going through.\nOf course, I don't mind. I believe deeply in John and what he's fighting for to bring hope and opportunity to all Americans. It is an honor to stand with him in this campaign, and I know Laura Bush feels the same way about her husband.\nNonetheless, it certainly is nice to be here with a group of women who want to talk about something other than politics for a moment. Standing before this impressive group, I recall the words of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher: \"If you want anything said, ask a man, and if you want anything done, ask a woman.\"\nNow, I can hear the pundits already: \"There she goes again, being outspoken. This time she's criticizing men.\" You may have noticed-I get that kind of thing a lot. And all I can say is, Lighten up, fellas. It's just a joke.\nBut I will admit, it's a joke with a point. I believe the world needs to hear more from women. The world needs more of the qualities that are so clearly embodied in all of you.\nMy husband and I were introduced by my late husband John Heinz on Earth Day 1990, and our relationship began taking root at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992. So I suppose it should come as no surprise that we both draw inspiration from the natural world, and I want to preface my remarks with a metaphor that I drew from a visit to the Amazon jungle 14 years ago.\nThe most amazing experience for me was to stand beneath the jungle canopy towering 120 feet overhead. It truly had the feeling and simplicity of a gothic cathedral. The trees were like pillars, often anchored by buttress-like roots. They grew in a mere six inches of soil. You couldn't help but wonder what sustained them, and then you looked at the ground and saw the interplay of mosses, ferns, mushrooms, insects and animals, and you began to understand the beauty and complexity and interdependence of life.\nWe are, all of us, like those trees. Even they depend on the kindness of strangers, and so it is for us.\nNo matter how high we may sometimes soar, no matter how invincible we may sometimes feel, we are all fed and nurtured and sustained by complex webs of connection. We all truly are in this together.\nThat, of course, is the essential but too often forgotten wisdom that lies at the heart of all the world's great religions-that we should love others as we love ourselves. And it is the wisdom at the heart of all true charity and philanthropy.\nMy life has taught me three great lessons about giving of yourself, as a volunteer, an activist or a philanthropist, about tikkun olam, the notion that we must heal the world and make it a better place. I would like to share these lessons with you today, not as advice but as encouragement to a group of fellow travelers.\nFirst is that this journey of ours-this journey of sharing and giving-is not merely noble or kind. It is also immensely practical. It reveals the secret to the survival of the human race and of a planet worth inhabiting.\nMy First exposure to that came from my father, when I was a girl growing up in Mozambique. He was a doctor who sometimes allowed me to accompany him on his rounds. I was always amazed by how much time he devoted to each of his patients-how he would hug them, ask them about their lives, and listen carefully to every story, every detail they shared.\nI thought he was just being kind, but slowly I learned there was a method to his kindness. The time he devoted to his patients also made him a better doctor. It gave him clues that he used in his treatments. And it was a practical investment that produced tangible results.\nI have seen that pattern play out time and again in the work we do at our foundations. Several years ago, The Heinz Endowments funded a program to give young children access to high quality early education. There are sound scientific reasons to invest in programs like this, because of what we now know about how the brain develops in the preschool years. But these programs are costly, and we wanted to know whether the benefits justify the cost.\nHere is what we learned. The number of children in our program needing special education, which costs significantly more than preschool programs, dropped from 1 in 5 to 1 in 100. The number of kindergartners and first-graders not being promoted dropped from 1 in 4 to 1 in 50.\nIt is difficult to imagine a better return on investment than that, especially when you think about how those numbers translate into children succeeding in school and not ending up in trouble. Good, thoughtful philanthropy often produces returns like that. In my personal foundation we are designing programs that are helping keep prescription drug costs affordable for seniors and helping educate women about how cleaning up the environment also protects our health and the well-being of our children.\nThose are real results that benefit us all. When we truly understand that we are all part of an interconnected web, we realize that in helping others, we are also helping ourselves.\nThe second great lesson life has taught me about giving of ourselves is that this journey requires courage. As a young woman, I attended the University of Witswatersrand in South Africa at a time when the government was preparing to extend apartheid's ugly reach into higher education. My fellow students and I risked arrest to march through the streets in protest.\nWhat I learned from that experience was not that we shouldn't have bothered. Rather, I learned that sometimes it is important to speak out even when we think no one is listening, and perhaps especially then. We cannot always know how our words or deeds will resonate across time and along the strands of human connection. All we can know is that absent affirmative acts of individual conscience, evil triumphs.\nTo me, those protests were their own small act of philanthropy. So often considered a genteel act, true philanthropy frequently takes us in directions that require strength and sacrifice and risk.\nNever was that so evident to me as when, years later, I as a young Senate wife in 1977 helped launch and then co-chaired Congressional Wives for Soviet Jewry. The women and men I met when we traveled to stand with them in the Soviet Union-giants like Ida Nudel, Judith Rattner and Vladimir Slepak-were giving something of themselves to others. The world knew them as refuseniks. They viewed themselves as standing up for freedom of religion, for the dignity of their families and their people, for the hope of a place where they could live in freedom.\nIt did not take great courage for us as Congressional wives to challenge the human rights abuses of the Soviet Union. But it did take a willingness to honor and support the bravery of those men and women who were risking their lives to speak out. It did require us to care enough about their plight to want to do something about it, to stand for those who could not stand entirely on their own, to speak for the voiceless and to shine light on the courage of the defiant.\nThat concept lies at the very core of good philanthropy. Even in ways that, compared to the sacrifices of the refuseniks, might seem utterly mundane, philanthropy is all about embracing risk. From poverty to oppression, from religious intolerance to ethnic hatred, from injustice to environmental destruction-there are no easy or obvious solutions to the great challenges of our time.\nThere is only the hope of human ingenuity. It is the task of philanthropy to cultivate that ingenuity, to support new ideas, new solutions, and new ways of applying old wisdom. In the new there is always risk, because that which has been untried might fail. But we cannot shy from that. At our foundations, we expect a certain amount of failure. We don't like it, but we believe our job is to support the experimenters, the innovators and the trail-blazers, because in them lies all hope for progress. To share the failures and the successes, because in the lessons we learn, we find the way forward.\nThe early childhood program I mentioned earlier never did reach the number of children we had hoped it would and had to be scaled back. You could view that as a failure. We chose instead to capture the learning from that effort and share it widely, and last year that information helped convince Pennsylvania finally to join the overwhelming majority of states funding early childhood programs. In philanthropy as in life, those who dare not fail can never succeed. The third great lesson I have learned about giving of ourselves is that, although it requires strength, it provides strength in even greater measure. There is a great misconception about philanthropy that it depends on the size of one's pocketbook. But what it really depends on is the size of one's heart, the openness of one's mind, a sense of conviction and an ability to leverage.\nFrom my father embracing his patients and hearing their stories, to my fellow students marching in support of justice, to women and men like the Soviet refuseniks fighting for freedom, I have learned that the greatest gift we can give each other is the gift of our time and our ideas and our work. It is the gift of whatever we have to give, the gift of whatever we have inside of us.\nI have seen that type of philanthropy practiced so many times since coming to America four decades ago. Here I discovered a land remarkably different from any I had known before. People here spoke their mind, and didn't object if you did the same-well, at times, some do if your husband is running for President.\nAnd people here believe anything is possible, that anyone can set his or her sights on a dream and, with enough hard work, make it happen. So much has been made of that promise of individual opportunity that we often forget it has a flipside. For me, however, that flipside is the most remarkable aspect of America.\nIt is an ethic of individual obligation, a profound sense that with freedom comes responsibility. I see that ethic reflected in my husband, and both he and I believe it is the glue that holds this nation together and makes it great.\nOne of my earliest friends in this country was Fred Rogers, who created Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. After 9/11, Fred was asked what parents should tell their children to alleviate their anxiety over all the horrifying images appearing on television. He recounted something his own mother had told him when he saw grisly photographs in the newspaper. \"Look for the helpers,\" she would say. \"You will always find people who are helping.\"\nAmerica is a nation of helpers. I have never met a people more willing as individuals to help out in ways small and great, to assist a neighbor in need, to extend the hand of friendship to a young woman newly arrived from Africa, or-as we saw on 9/11-to rush into a burning building to save the lives of complete strangers. That generous, philanthropic spirit, more than anything else, gives America its strength and sets it apart among the community of nations.\nThere is a wonderful saying from the Talmud that I think perfectly captures the tension of our own times: \"If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?\"\nWhat philanthropy teaches is that a spirit of generosity and connection and mutual respect does not require us to sacrifice ourselves. Rather, it reminds us that, in being for others, we are also for ourselves. In strengthening and respecting others, we strengthen and respect ourselves.\nI think women, in particular, understand that. I am happy to say I am married to a man who also gets it, but I do think for women it comes naturally. In our roles as mothers and wives, women have for millennia managed the chaos of family and community. We have an intuitive sense for the importance of those connections.\nThat ancient wisdom is reflected in the symbol you have chosen for your work, the Lion of Judah. Like the trees I encountered in the Amazon, the lion is a symbol of strength and power. But even the lion's strength is measured by the health of the pride, and the prosperity of the land.\nAnd that is why John and I both applaud the work of the National Women's Philanthropy and United Jewish Communities. In you, we see more than a great organization. We see hope-hope for our country, for the promised land of Israel, for the worldwide Jewish community, for women, and indeed for people all around this troubled globe of ours. You illustrate what can happen when strong women embrace their power and their wisdom, and come together to make their voices heard.\nAt a time when the world is more interconnected than ever in its history, and challenged by global collisions of economies, beliefs and cultures, it needs the wisdom that women like you offer. Margaret Mead once said, \"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed people can change the world: indeed it's the only thing that ever has.\" To that I would add, and never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed women can lead the way. And if not us, who? If not now, when?\nLions of Judah, I salute you and thank you for all you do.", "timestamp": "2004-10-17", "title": "Remarks of Teresa Heinz Kerry at the Lion of Judah Conference in Washington, DC"}

And now the time has come for the American people to make that choice. I believe that we need a President who defends America and fights for the middle class.\nFor the last four years, that has not been the case.\nJust today, we learned that the top U.S. Commander in Iraq had to plead with the Pentagon for critical supplies to counter the growing insurgency. Lt. General Ricardo Sanchez argued that without increased supplies, \"I cannot continue to support sustained combat operations.\" The day after General Sanchez wrote his letter, George Bush went out and told the American people our troops were properly equipped.\nDespite the President's arrogant boasting that he's done everything right in Iraq and that he's made no mistakes, the truth is beginning to catch up with him.\nJust last week, General Tommy Franks admitted that disbanding the Iraqi army last year was a mistake and created a dangerous security vacuum. Ambassador Paul Bremer now admits the President didn't have enough troops on the ground to secure Iraq and that the White House ignored his warnings. Then when General Shinseki said we didn't have enough troops to get the job done, he was sent packing. Republican Senators, Lugar, Hagel and McCain, have all complained about the mismanagement and incompetence of the President and his team. And now Iraq is a breeding ground for terrorism.\nBut despite all these facts, the President still clings to the idea that we're making progress, that things are getting better in Iraq and that his policy is working. Mr. President, when it comes to the war in Iraq, it's time to come clean and acknowledge what your military leaders have been telling you privately. Mr. President, you can choose to ignore the facts, but in the end you can't hide the truth from the American people. The bottom line, Mr. President: your mismanagement of the war has made Iraq and America less safe and less secure than they could have and should have been today.\nAs president, I will never rush to war without a plan to win the peace. I will never send our soldiers into harms way without the best training and equipment in the world. I will never allow our policy to be hijacked by ideologues at the expense of the best advice from our best military commanders.\nMost of all, I will always level with the American people. Our troops deserve the truth, the American people deserve the truth, and we deserve a fresh start in Iraq.\nAs president, I will never take my eye off the real enemy: Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, and other terrorists that threaten America and our allies. I will fight a tougher war on terror. We will hunt down, capture, and kill the terrorists no matter where they are. But we will conduct the critical diplomacy this administration has failed to do. We will bring allies to our side because that's how you make America strongest. Just because President Bush couldn't do it doesn't mean it can't be done.\nBut a President must be able to do more than one thing at a time. And today, I want to talk about one of the great issues that matter to middle-class families all across America.\nToday is the first day you can vote here in Florida. Today, health care is on the ballot.\nIn a message sent to Congress nearly sixty years ago, President Harry Truman said, \"We should resolve now that the health of this nation is a national concern; that financial barriers in the way...of health shall be removed; that the health of all citizens deserves the help of all the nation.\"\nSixty years later, for the millions of middle-class families struggling to keep up with their medical bills, the concern has never been greater, the barriers have never been higher, and the need for a solution to the crisis of rising health care costs is a defining issue for America.\nToday, I'm here to tell you that this solution is finally within our reach.\nWe can and will get the cost of health care under control.\nWe can and will cover all children in America.\nWe can and will give families access to the same private health insurance that members of Congress give themselves.\nWe can and will put medical decisions in the hands of the doctors and patients – not insurance company bureaucrats.\nWe can have a fresh start on health care in America, and when I am President, we will.\nWhen I am President, health care will be the very first proposal I send to the United States Congress. I will work with Republicans and Democrats on this health care plan, and we will pass it.\nIt's time to help families sitting around the kitchen table, worrying, how will we pay that hospital bill? How did our premiums go up again? Should we drop our coverage and hope nothing happens? But what about the kids?\nThese worries are real, and they're happening all across America.\nIn Erie, Pennsylvania, I met a man named Albert Barker, who wonders how he'll pay thousands of dollars in medical bills. After he suffered a heart attack and underwent surgery, his employer stopped his health coverage because it was too expensive. Now his wife says she just hopes and prays nothing else happens. That's wrong, and we have to change it.\nIn Council Bluffs, Iowa, I met a woman named Myrtle Walck, who doesn't know what she'll do if the price of her medicine rises any higher. As it is, she pays a good chunk of her Social Security check – her only source of income – to the drugstore every month just to cover the cost of her two daily prescriptions. That's wrong, and we have to change it.\nAnd right here in Florida, up in Jacksonville, I met Renee Harris, who owned a school bus company that was in her family for over fifty years. But recently, she was forced to sell it because she could no longer afford to insure her workers or herself. That's wrong, and we have to change it.\nMillions of middle-class families like these are working hard and trying to get ahead, but they just can't keep up with health care costs that are out of control. Employers are being forced to cut benefits or cut jobs. And a study due out tomorrow will find that significant numbers of uninsured veterans don't have access to health care.\nJust think about the last four years. Health care costs up 64%. Prescription drug co-pays up 50%. Medicare up 56%. Average family premiums are up over $3,500 a year. 5 million more Americans have no health care, bringing the total to 45 million with no coverage at all.\nAnd what does the President of the United States have to say about these out-of-control health care costs that are killing job creation and hurting middle-class families? In the debate the other night, he called these problems \"a litany of complaints.\"\nThere you have it folks. George Bush's answer to our health care problems is to tell the American people: stop whining. That's George Bush, isn't it?\nLower wages and a higher share of the tax burden for the middle-class? Stop whining, everything's fine.\n45 million Americans with no health insurance at all? Stop whining, everything's fine.\nTens of millions of American families who can barely hold on to their health insurance and who face higher co-pays and deductibles every year? Stop whining, everything's fine.\nMr. President, the struggles facing middle-class families are not complaints to be dismissed, they are realities to be dealt with. And when I am President, that's what I'll do.\nOf course, it wouldn't be fair to say that George Bush has done nothing about the high cost of health care – he's actually made it worse. And if given the chance, he'll make it much worse. That's because this President isn't just out of touch with middle-class Americans. George Bush is in touch with the big drug companies, the insurance industry and the HMOs.\nIt's wrong to run for president promising you'll do something about the cost of prescription drugs only to force through a Medicare bill four years later that gives a windfall profit of $139 billion to the big drug companies, and raises the cost of medicine for seniors.\nIt's wrong to make it illegal to import less expensive prescription drugs from Canada.\nIt's wrong to make it illegal for Medicare to negotiate with the drug companies for lower prices.\nIt's wrong to tie up $1 billion in funding for children's health care and deny coverage to 750,000 kids.\nAnd it's wrong to offer a phony health care plan – the Bush plan -- that would raise premiums on four out of every five small businesses.\nMy friends, when it comes to health care, George Bush just doesn't get it. And if there was any doubt before, his response to the shortage of flu vaccines put it to rest. With senior citizens standing in line for hours and mothers frantic about how to protect their children, the President gave the public his solution: don't get a flu shot. And just today we learned that a town in New Jersey is being forced to use a lottery system to decide who will get a flu shot. So now, George Bush is telling us you have to get lucky to get health care.\nLadies and Gentlemen, here's the Bush Health Care Plan: Don't get a flu shot, don't import less expensive drugs, don't negotiate for lower prices, and most of all, don't get sick.\nAnd so there's only one way to avoid another four years of hearing \"don't\" from this President when it comes to health care: Don't vote for George W. Bush.\nHe isn't just out of touch with middle-class Americans, he's more than in touch with the big drug companies, the insurance industry and the HMOs. And we're paying the price.\nSo now it is time to choose.\nDo we want four more years of a President who stands with the HMOs and the drug companies and tells the struggling middle-class that everything's just fine? Or do we want a President who will honor middle-class values and fight for middle-class families?\nI believe we need a fresh start on health care in America. I believe we need a President who will fight for the great middle-class and those struggling to join it. And with your help, I will be that kind of President.\nHere is exactly what we'll do to make health care affordable and available for all Americans:\nFirst, we'll bring down the costs. We'll cut prescription drug prices by allowing people to buy safe drugs from Canada. We'll allow Medicare to negotiate with the drug companies to get lower prices. We'll cut the waste in the health care system and cut the cost of health insurance for families. And we'll cut the costs for small businesses by providing them with a tax credit when they cover their employees.\nSecond, we'll make sure that everyone can get more affordable health insurance. We'll do it by giving families and small businesses access to the same health coverage that members of Congress give themselves. Families will be able to choose from dozens of different private insurance plans. It's time for middle-class families to have that choice, because your health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington DC. We'll also make sure that Americans with disabilities have access to affordable health care that fits their needs. We'll protect the programs they count on and we'll ensure that these Americans can make choices about the kind of care they receive and where they will receive it.\nThird, we'll cover every child in America by automatically signing them up for health care – for example, the first time they go to a hospital, or the first day of school. The idea that in the richest country on Earth, there are children who have to go to the Emergency Room whenever they're sick in the slightest way, is a failure of our value system. It is immoral, and it will end when I am President. When I'm president, you won't need to win the lottery to get health care.\nFourth, we will pass a Patients Bill of Rights to make sure that doctors and patients – not insurance company or government officials – make the medical decisions our health depends on.\nFinally, I will offer real Presidential leadership to protect the health and safety of the American public so we don't face another crisis like the one we have today with flu vaccines. The administration was warned about the shortage flu vaccines three years ago, and they didn't act. Here's what we'll do: We'll crack down on the price-gouging that's putting vaccines out of reach for people who need them today. We'll provide incentives to manufacturers to ensure that we have enough suppliers and enough vaccines to protect the American public. And we'll encourage more research to discover more efficient ways to produce better vaccines.\nNow, I know that George Bush is out there distorting my health care plan because he can't talk about his own. But here's the truth: My plan is based on incentives and the marketplace. It is not a government plan. It offers more choice, and guarantees that you can pick your own doctor. And every single dime of it is paid for by rolling back the unaffordable Bush tax giveaways for only those making over $200,000. The rest of America will get a tax cut, and Americans will get affordable health care.\nWe can do this. After four years of a President who always gave the powerful and well-connected a handout instead of giving middle-class families a hand-up, I believe America is ready for a fresh start on health care. I believe we're ready to leave the failed policies of the past behind, and look toward the future with the hope that America will finally fulfill the promise that Harry Truman first dared to dream sixty years ago – the promise that in the richest country on Earth, health care is not a privilege for the elected, connected, or the wealthy, it is a right for all Americans.\nThis can be our future. We just need to come together as One America and believe in ourselves. We can bring back that mighty dream.\nRemember, Florida has a head start in this election -- early voting starts today. This is a great opportunity. You can vote right now or any day between today and November 2nd. So please go to a location in your community as soon as you can. I need your help and I need your vote, so that together we can build an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world. You have my pledge: You get to the polls – we'll make sure that this time, every vote counts and every vote is counted.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2004-10-18", "title": "Remarks in Tampa, Florida"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29743", "text": "Thank you – it's great to be back in Wilkes-Barre.\nWe face a fundamental choice in this election – the choice of a lifetime – and a choice that couldn't be clearer.\nI believe that we need a President who defends America and fights for the middle class.\nWhen I am President, we will make a fresh start in Iraq to bring in our allies and train Iraqis so that we can succeed and bring our troops home. I will fight a tougher, smarter, more effective war on terror. We will hunt down, capture, and kill the terrorists wherever they are.\nBut a President has to be able to do more than one thing at a time. And today, I want to talk about one of the great issues that matter to middle-class families all across America – saving Social Security.\nSeventy-two years ago today, another candidate for President by the name of Franklin Roosevelt came here to Pennsylvania to discuss how we could restore America's prosperity and America's future.\nAt that time, this nation was in the depths of the Great Depression.\nThe incumbent president then, Herbert Hoover, had actually lost jobs on his watch – and so has George W. Bush – the first president in 11 presidents to do so.\nHe failed to restore our economic prosperity – and so has George W. Bush.\nAnd as Roosevelt said, President Hoover's policies had jeopardized, \"the welfare of our people and the credit of our country\" – and so has George W. Bush's.\nSeventy-two years later, it's Deja vu all over again.\nGeorge W. Bush has become the first President since Herbert Hoover to lose jobs on his watch. He has become the first president in more than 70 years to have the incomes of American families decline in each year of his presidency. He has become the first President to turn a record surplus into the largest deficit in history. And he has become the first President to launch an all-out assault on Social Security since Franklin Roosevelt first signed the program into law.\nWhat George Bush still doesn't understand is that his four year spending spree on tax giveaways for millionaires has undermined the hopes of middle-class families and put Social Security on a dangerous road. Now he's asking for another four years to privatize the program, and undo the sacred compact we've made with our seniors.\nWell I'm here to tell you that even though this is George Bush's plan, it doesn't have to be our future. And now is our moment to choose. Do we want four more years of a President who gives more to those with the most and tells a struggling middle-class that everything's just fine? Or do we want a President who will honor middle-class values and fight for middle-class opportunities?\nI believe that we can protect Social Security for our seniors, lift up middle-class families, and keep America's promise to our children and our grandchildren. And when I'm President, that's exactly what we'll do.\nWe need a fresh start in America. Because the truth is, middle-class families can't afford another four years of the Bush economy – four more years of policies that have weakened America.\nIt's time to stop rewarding companies for shipping jobs overseas.\nIt's time to create good jobs in America again instead of jobs that pay $9000 less than the ones they replaced.\nAnd it's time to save Social Security instead of raiding it and privatizing it.\nBecause George Bush has spent his way into the largest deficits in American history, the retirement of millions and the future of our children are now at risk. A child born today will inherit a $20,000 debt – a \"Birth Tax\" that he or she had no part in creating. And middle-class Americans who have worked a lifetime may be forced to choose between a retirement of more hard work or hard times. That's wrong, that's a betrayal of the middle-class, and we can't let it happen in our America.\nSocial Security is part of the promise of America. It's a sacred compact between generations. If you work hard and contribute to your country, you can retire with a level of decency and dignity. Imagine if that was taken away? Imagine if your parents or your grandparents had to work on the factory floor long into their 70s – into their 80s? Imagine if they had to sell the house you grew up in to pay for their food or their medicine? This is wrong, this is devastating, this is the reckless course on which George Bush has placed this nation, and we have to change it. As president, I will set a new direction for America – a new direction for America's middle class.\nOn November 2nd, Social Security is on the ballot. A choice between one candidate who will save Social Security – and another who will undermine it.\nWhen this President took office, he inherited the largest surplus in American history -- $5.6 trillion that could have saved Social Security for generations.\nAs my friend President Clinton likes to say, if you see a turtle sitting on a fence post, you know it didn't get there by itself. The surplus was the culmination of a 15-year, bipartisan battle to get federal spending and the federal budget under control. Back in the 1980's, I broke with my party and joined with reformers like Warren Rudman, a Republican from New Hampshire, to push for deficit reduction. It wasn't a popular position, but I believed then – as I do now – that it was the right thing to do.\nIn the 1990s, we finished the job. We brought Democrats and Republicans together to pass a historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement. We not only balanced the budget for the first time in decades, we created the opportunity to save Social Security for generations to come. It didn't matter whether you were a Republican or Democrat – it only mattered that we were doing the right thing for our children, our seniors, and the millions of middle-class families struggling to get ahead.\nThis President had a historic bipartisan opportunity to protect Social Security. Instead, George Bush squandered that moment and raided the Social Security trust fund for tax breaks that gave the most to those who needed it least.\nNot once, not twice, but three times, he spent billions and billions on tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals and biggest corporations He even proposed to use your Social Security money to give Enron a $254 million tax rebate. In fact, the money he spent on tax cuts for those with an average income of over $1 million a year could have saved Social Security for 75 years.\nIn 2000, George Bush promised the American people that he would never touch the money in the Social Security Trust Fund. Within months of taking office, he broke that promise. All told, he has taken more than $500 billion of your Social Security. Today, the surplus is gone, and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve says that the only way to pay for George Bush's reckless tax cuts is to cut Social Security. Well let me say it loud and clear – when I am President, that's not going to happen.\nJust today, America's seniors got some more bad news. For a typical senior, nearly half of this year's Social Security cost of living adjustment is going to be eaten away by the record rise in Medicare premiums. And for 2 million seniors, their entire cost of living increase will be completely wiped out by the higher Medicare premiums. That leaves less money for food, medicine, and even an occasional gift for a grandchild. That's wrong and when I'm president, I'm going to change it.\nGeorge Bush now says he has a plan for Social Security. And it's even worse than what he's already done. For the millions of middle-class families who wonder whether Social Security will be there when they retire, George Bush's answer, in his own words, is this: \"I'm going to come out strong after my swearing in with...privatizing of Social Security.\" Mr. President, that's one January surprise we can all live without.\nGeorge Bush wants to finish the job he started in his first term. He wants to be the first President in history to put the greatest retirement program in American history at risk – a program built by generations of sacrifice and hard work. This is what the President must mean when he talks about his \"ownership society\": when it comes to your retirement, you're on your own.\nThis is no secret – this is his plan – and it's out there for anyone who wants to see it. He even hand-picked a commission to recommend privatizing Social Security.\nAccording to the President's own Council of Economic Advisors, the plan laid out by that commission would blow a $2 trillion hole in the Social Security trust fund.\nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the Bush privatization plan would cut Social Security benefits. It will cut them by 23 to 45 percent.\nAnd of course, while the President doesn't seem to understand the pain his privatization plan will cause middle-class families, he certainly knows the pleasure it will provide financial institutions – who will earn a $940 billion windfall for managing these private accounts.\n$940 billion for the investment houses – lower benefits for seniors, and a higher tax bill for you.\nIf George Bush can't see how spending away our children's future on tax cuts for those who don't need them, he never will. If he can't understand why raiding the Social Security trust fund means risking our future, he'll keep on doing it. And if he doesn't get why sacrificing the retirement of millions of middle-class families to reward the powerful and well-connected is wrong, well then, he has proven beyond a doubt that he's out of touch. His only new ideas are bad ideas.\nBut the good news is, we now have the chance to leave all this behind.\nMy friends, it's time to Save Social Security. And that means George Bush's time is up. We're ready for a fresh start in America.\nJohn Edwards and I have a real plan to cut the budget deficit in half and protect Social Security. It will take some tough choices – cutting corporate welfare, streamlining government, and finding ways to pay for every program we propose -- but that's what leadership is about – and that's the leadership I will provide as the President of the United States.\nFirst, I will not privatize of Social Security. I will not cut benefits. I will not raise the retirement age. Because when you've worked hard for a lifetime, America owes you what you've earned.\nSecond, every budget I send to Congress will detail how we intend to pay for every proposal. And we'll restore the simple rule that George W. Bush opposes: pay-as-you-go.\nThat's what we have done in this campaign. Every proposal I have made details how we plan to pay for it.\nAnd we're going to go further – we'll go after wasteful government spending and bloated government contracts – because you deserve a government that works better and costs less.\nThird, I will ask Congress for constitutionally-permissible line item veto to slice the pork out of the federal budget.\nAccording to Citizens Against Government Waste, this year's budget includes more than 10,000 pork-barrel projects – more than double the number of pork barrel projects when George Bush came into office. And this president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that.\nGive me that line item veto pen, and I will cut the fat out of the budget.\nFourth, John Edwards and I will fight for automatic spending cuts if Congress can't keep spending in check.\nThis President not only ignored the spending caps we had in place since the 1990's --he got rid of them.\nHe got rid of these rules, I will restore them.\nFinally, I will implement the McCain-Kerry proposal to end corporate welfare as we know it.\nIt's time to stop asking taxpayers to subsidize loopholes and giveaways to make rich corporations richer. Today, there are more than 100 corporate welfare programs in the budget that cost you more than $65 billion a year.\nThe McCain-Kerry proposal crosses party lines.\nSo far, John can't get anyone in the Bush White House to listen to it. Well I'll tell you what -- when I'm President, John McCain will get the first pen when I sign this bill into law.\nMy friends, this isn't about being a Democrat or a Republican. It's about what's right for America.\nThe hope for a better future is one that has sustained our nation through its best moments and its darkest days.\nWhen Franklin Roosevelt came to Pennsylvania 72 years ago today, that hope seemed almost lost.\nBut the American people rose up and they forged a new future.\nFDR believed, as you do, and I do, that America's an optimistic country – that the American dream belongs to each and every one of us...that there's nothing we can't do if we just believe in ourselves.\nWe simply can't risk destroying our fundamental compact between generations -- when you work hard and play by the rules, America should work hard to take care of you when you retire. That was Franklin Roosevelt's essential promise when he created Social Security and it's been the sacred obligation one generation has passed on to the next. I believe we're all in this together. George Bush believes you're out there on your own.\nWe can't afford to undermine our sacred compact between generations. We can't afford four more years of George Bush. We need a fresh start.\nFDR's words from seven decades ago still have a powerful meaning today. He said here in Pennsylvania: \"I am as certain as mortal man can be certain...that from the moment that we set our hands openly and frankly and courageously to this problem, we shall have reached the end of our long, hard ... road ....\"\nOn November 2nd, we will reach the end of this \"long, hard\" road ... and together we will take America in a new direction.\nSo I ask you to stand up on November 2nd. I ask for your vote and your help so we can give our country back its future.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-10-19", "title": "Remarks in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29744", "text": "Thank you for that kind introduction. It's an honor to be here at the Five Sullivan Brothers Convention Center. We all know about those five brothers who were lost in the same ship in the Second World War, and what that kind of sacrifice means to American families and to our nation. Like the countless others who've given their lives in service, they are the greatness of America. We pause to salute them today and here in Waterloo every day you honor what they gave to our country.\nI'm also honored to be surrounded this morning by four of our finest military leaders -- generals and admirals who know combat, who know what's going on in Iraq, and who know what it takes to keep America safe. Admiral Stansfield Turner, former Director of the CIA, General Claudia Kennedy, the highest ranking woman to ever serve in our armed forces, General Edward Baca, former head of our National Guard, and General Melvyn Montano, of the National Guard – who both know how important our reservist and guard are to America's defense, and who believe with me that they should never be subject to a backdoor draft.\nAnd while they are not able to be here today, I am proud to have the support in this race, two former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff under both President Reagan and President Clinton – Admiral William Crowe and General John Shalikashvili. I'm proud that these leaders are standing with me not just in this campaign, but for the cause of a stronger America.\nAnd I am proud to have the support of so many of the widows of 9-11 led by Kristen Breitweiser, who's also with us today.\nThe other day, in a speech full of distortions, the president made it clear that he can't talk about most of the issues in this election. He wants to make it solely a contest about national security. I welcome that debate. I believe a President must be able to defend this country and fight for the middle class. I believe a president has to do both at the same time. And I believe this president has failed to make our country as safe and secure as it should be.\nAmerica is fighting... and must win... two wars. The war in Iraq. And the war on terror.\nPresident Bush likes to confuse the two. He claims that Iraq is the centerpiece of the war on terror. In fact, Iraq was a profound diversion from that war and the battle against our greatest enemy: Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda network.\nBut now that we're fighting two wars, we must... and we will... prevail in both. In Iraq, because the President's miscalculations have created a terrorist haven that wasn't there before. And in the worldwide struggle against the terrorists, because they attacked us ... and because they represent the greatest threat to security in our time.\nIn Iraq, every week brings fresh evidence that President Bush doesn't see what's happening – isn't leveling with the American people about why we went to war in Iraq...how the war is going – and has no idea how to put our policy back on track.\nHere's what Americans have learned over the past two weeks:\n-- The President's top weapons inspector in Iraq released a final, exhaustive study, with this damning conclusion: Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction and no programs to produce them.\nIraq was in fact a diminishing threat. The main reason President Bush gave for rushing to war was wrong.\nA CIA report found no clear link between Saddam's regime and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the terrorist behind the beheadings of Americans in Iraq and now an al Qaeda ally.\nBefore the war, the administration claimed that Zarqawi's presence in Iraq was proof of an Al Qaeda-Saddam collaboration. That was wrong.\nIn fact, Zarqawi was operating out of a no-man's land in North Eastern Iraq... next to territory controlled by America's Kurdish allies... not by Saddam. He and his terrorist allies were reportedly producing Ricin, a horrific biological weapon. We could have... but did not... take them out. That was a terrible mistake that this administration has never explained.\nPaul Bremer, the President's man in Baghdad, and several senior generals have said the administration did not send enough troops to Iraq to manage the aftermath of the war.\nThat failure made it impossible to stop widespread looting and crime, to secure Iraq's borders against terrorists, and to guard one million tons of ammunition and weapons that wound up in the hands of insurgents who are using them against our troops.\nAnd the failure left a power vacuum filled by Saddam loyalists... Shi'a extremists... and international terrorists, who were not in Iraq before the war, but have found a haven there now.\nAnd finally, the American people learned that, nine months ago, the top U.S. commander in Iraq pleaded with the Pentagon for critical supplies to counter the growing insurgency – all of which our troops should have before they want to war -- including 36,000 sets of body armor, and spare parts for tanks, helicopters and fighting vehicles.\nThe very next day, President Bush went out and declared that our troops were properly equipped.\nThat's what Americans learned.\nBut what did the President learn? Apparently, nothing. He is in denial. He ignored these findings... just as, before the war, he ignored the uniformed military, leaders of both parties in Congress, and outside experts who predicted virtually every problem we now face in Iraq... just as today, against all the evidence, he insists that we're making good progress.\nBut the facts are grim: the coalition has lost control of areas where 1 million Iraqis live. U.S. forces are attacked an average of 87 times a day – up 100% since the spring. Over 130 foreigners kidnapped in Iraq since March.\nMake no mistake: our troops are the best-trained and best-led forces in the world, and they have been doing their job honorably and bravely. The problem is the commander-in-chief has not being doing his.\nIf President Bush cannot recognize the problems in Iraq, he will not fix them. I do recognize them and I'll fix them.\nAll Americans are concerned about the outcome in Iraq. Now, they have a choice. More of the same failed policy. Or a fresh start.\nThe President believes we're stronger when we act alone. I believe America is stronger when we lead strong alliances.\nGetting more countries with us in Iraq won't be easy now. In fact, this President makes it harder every day.\nBut, with new leadership, a fresh start, and new credibility, I believe it can be done... because chaos in Iraq is as bad for our allies and Iraq's neighbors as it is for us. It's in their self-interest to prevent Iraq from becoming a permanent terrorist haven in the heart of the Middle East.\nFirst, we must show other countries that we have a clear strategy for success.\nRight now, other countries don't believe we have one... and they don't want to be part of a failure.\nLast month, I spelled out my strategy in detail. Now, President Bush claims my plan is what he's already doing. He couldn't be more wrong – or more out of touch with reality.\nLast month, I said we had to get serious about training Iraqi security forces.\nPresident Bush then boasted that we have \"trained about 100,000 Iraqi soldiers, police officers and other security forces personnel.\" In fact, the Pentagon told Congress that we have trained only 22,700 minimally effective forces, including just 5,000 soldiers.\nInstead of building a serious training program, the administration wasted 18 months putting untrained Iraqis into uniform to justify the inflated numbers it was giving out to the American public.\nThe result is that, for all their bravery, too few Iraqi security forces are ready for duty.\nHere's what my administration will do differently.\nWe will treat the training of Iraqi security forces as the war time emergency it is. We will urgently expand the training program inside and outside Iraq. We will strengthen the vetting of recruits... double classroom training time... and get serious about field training. We will recruit thousands of trainers from our allies and work with them to open training centers in Europe.\nPresident Bush isn't doing that. I will.\nLast month, I said we must carry out a reconstruction plan that brings real benefits to the Iraqi people.\nIn his recent speech, the President claimed: \"we've already allocated $7 billion for reconstruction efforts so more Iraqis can see the benefits of freedom.\"\nHere's what he didn't tell us. Allocated does not mean spent. It's Washington-speak calculated to mislead Americans into thinking the government has done something it hasn't.\nIn fact, only 8 percent of what this President promised has actually been spent.\nAnd even worse, of the amount actually spent, just 27 cents on the dollar trickles down to projects that help Iraqis. Where do the other 73 cents go? To soaring security costs ... corruption and mismanagement ... and huge profits for contractors like Halliburton.\nIs it any wonder that respected Republicans like Senator Richard Lugar talk about the \"incompetence of the Administration\" in Iraq?\nHere's what my administration will do differently.\nWe will target high visibility, quick impact projects... put the personnel we need in place... and cut through the red tape. We will use more Iraqi contractors and workers, instead of big corporations like Halliburton. We will stop paying companies under investigation for fraud and corruption. And we will fire the civilians in the Pentagon responsible for mismanaging the reconstruction program.\nThe President isn't doing that. I will.\nLast month, I said that we must take urgent, essential steps to guarantee promised elections can be held next year, including supporting the U.N. elections mission in Iraq\nIn his speech, the President said \"those elections are already scheduled for January... and the U.N. is already there.\"\nBut once again, that's Washington speak and it's misleading. Scheduled does not mean they have the ability to do it.\nIn fact, the U.N. says the elections are in grave doubt because of the deteriorating security situation. There are only five U.N. election experts on the ground in Iraq. We need hundreds more, but there is no security force in place to protect them.\nHere's what my administration will do differently.\nWe will recruit troops from other nations for a U.N. protection force. Unbelievably, we just learned that the President rejected an offer by Arab and Muslim nations to provide those troops. This was a costly failure of judgment, rooted in an ideological commitment to go it alone.\nWe will intensify the training of Iraqis to work at the polls and guard as many as 30,000 polling places. We will make sure an independent Iraqi electoral commission has the equipment and ballots it needs.\nThe President isn't doing all this. I will.\nIf President Bush really thinks his administration is implementing my plan for Iraq, he's even more out of touch with reality than I thought.\nThe second thing we must do to bring the world with us in Iraq is to give other countries a real say and a real stake – and treat them with respect.\nAt every turn... before the war... in its immediate aftermath... and today...this Administration has treated potential allies with disdain. As a result, nearly 90 percent of the coalition troops – and nearly 90 percent of the coalition casualties – are American.\nBefore the war, the U.N. Security Council voted 15-0 to demand that Saddam let the weapons inspectors back in... and threatened serious consequences if Iraq tried to stop them.\nBut our allies urged us to let the inspectors finish their work... and to make sure we had a plan to win the peace.\nThat was sound advice. It was reinforced here at home by General Brent Scowcroft, who was National Security Adviser to the first President Bush.\nBut this President wouldn't listen. He rushed to war.\nWe'll never know how many other countries would have been with us if this President had exercised sound judgment. But we do know that his disregard for other countries isolated America, not Iraq, from the rest of the world.\nThen, immediately after we took Baghdad, the President missed another opportunity to bring other nations abroad.\nRussia and India said they were open to sending peacekeepers... as many as 17,000.\nInstead of accepting their offer, President Bush let Vice President Cheney talk him out of giving the U.N. the role in Iraq these countries said they needed to get involved. The president acted like the divider, not the uniter, of a global coalition.\nThen, nine months after Saddam's statue fell, with the insurgency taking root, this President made a third critical misstep. Instead of reaching out to allies to get their help in training Iraqi security forces – which should have been our most urgent priority – this administration issued a new order prohibiting countries that were not part of the original coalition from participating in any reconstruction contracts in Iraq.\nIs it any wonder that the United States is still paying the overwhelming majority of the reconstruction costs in Iraq?\nBy treating other countries with contempt, President Bush gave them an excuse to stay on the sidelines instead of shouldering their responsibilities.\nAs President, I will treat our allies with respect. I will encourage them to help develop Iraq's resources and to bid on contracts. I will establish an international advisory group for Iraq that includes our key allies, the world's other major powers and Iraq's neighbors... to give them a voice... and to give Iraq the support and breathing room it needs to succeed.\nLast month, the president squandered a critical opportunity in New York, where he and other world leaders had gathered at the United Nations. I urged him to call a special summit on Iraq... right then and there... to get everyone in the room... and get commitments from them to send troops, trainers, a U.N. protection force, more financial aid and debt relief.\nIt was a decisive moment, but the President didn't even try. I will lead and I believe others will follow.\nThis President says he's a leader. Well Mr. President, look behind you. There's hardly anyone there. It's not leadership if we haven't built the strongest alliance possible and if America is almost alone.\nThe President's failures in Iraq have made us weaker, not stronger, in the war on terrorism. That is the hard truth. The President refuses to acknowledge it. But terrorism experts around the world do.\nThe Israelis know more about terrorism than anyone else because they have suffered more from it than anyone else – which is one reason we must always stand by their side.\nAnd here's what one of Israel's leading institutions – the Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies – just concluded in its annual report:\n\"...Iraq [is] a major distraction from the global war on terrorism. Iraq has now become a convenient arena for jihad, which has helped Al Qaeda to recover... The U.S. presence in Iraq now demands more and more assets that might have otherwise been deployed... against the global terrorist threat.\"\nThe President diverted our forces and focus from Afghanistan to Iraq. When Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda were cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, the President should have sent U.S. forces -- not Afghan warlords – to surround the caves, and he should have used America's best mountain troops and technology to hunt down, kill and capture the terrorists.\nBut Osama got away. And what did the President say? \"I truly am not that concerned about him.\"\nAnd what is the result? Far from being destroyed, al Qaeda has spread, with thousands of militants plotting and planning in 60 countries... forging new relationships with at least 20 extremist groups in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.\nGlobal terrorism is increasing, not receding. Since 9/11, the number of significant terrorist attacks has jumped to the highest level in 20 years.\nThe President took his eye off the terrorists.\nI will stop at nothing to kill the terrorists before they kill us... and prevent others from taking their place.\nThat requires America to be strong. It also requires America to be smart.\nMy plan for winning the war on terrorism calls on the totality of America's strength – our military, intelligence, economic and political power.\nFirst, we will destroy terrorist networks by transforming our military and reforming our intelligence services.\nI will expand our active duty forces by 40,000 soldiers... not for Iraq... but so that we have enough troops to fight the terrorists wherever they are. This administration has resisted that plan, while instituting a back-door draft for Iraq. They have it exactly backwards.\nI will double the Army's Special Forces capability to go after the terrorists. We will combine and grow the extraordinary fighting talent of all of our elite forces into the most versatile, deadly anti-terrorist force the world has ever known.\nThis administration opposed the creation of the 9/11 Commission, before bowing to public pressure. Now, it's dragging its feet on the Commission's bi-partisan recommendations to make America more secure.\nMr. President, it's time for leadership. It's time to implement the real 9/11 Commission intelligence recommendations that were passed by the Senate. Mr. President, if you don't do it now, I will do it in January.\nThe President's budget provides just 20 percent of the CIA's needs for its Counter Terrorism Center... and shortchanges our counter-terrorism efforts across the intelligence community.\nAs President, I will change that. I will be a determined leader, not a reluctant follower, when it comes to intelligence reform and funding the intelligence community.\nSecond, we will deny the terrorists the deadly weapons they seek.\nThose weapons were not in Iraq.\nBut tons and kilotons of poorly secured chemical and nuclear weapons are spread throughout the former Soviet Union.\nA decade ago, we began a bipartisan program to help Russia secure and destroy those weapons. This President actually tried to cut that program... and even after 9/11, he flat-lined it. At the rate President Bush is going, it will take 13 years to secure all the loose weapons in the former Soviet Union. I will get the job done in 4 years.\nI will also lead an international effort to end the dangerous nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran.\nUnder this President's watch, North Korea's nuclear arsenal has gone from one to two nuclear bombs to six to eight bombs today. That means that North Korea... a country that will sell anything to anyone... can sell nuclear weapons to terrorists and still hold an arsenal in reserve. On George Bush's watch, America is more threatened than ever before.\nI will work with our allies to get the 6-party talks back on track. And I will talk directly to the North Koreans... as our South Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Russian partners have requested... and seek a verifiable, irreversible end to North Korea's nuclear weapons program.\nNorth Korea is not the only gathering danger. While a divided administration has been bickering with itself about Iran, that country -- the world's most active sponsor of state terrorism -- has advanced its nuclear program.\nI will reassert American leadership. Iran must verifiably and permanently end the production of nuclear materials for weapons. If Iran refuses, I will lead the world to take tough measures, including sanctions.\nThird, we will cut off terrorist financing.\nAccording to the 9/11 Commission, this administration delayed pressuring the Saudis to shut down so-called charities that were in fact major sources of terrorist funding. They even waited until last week to turn off the financial pipeline to the terrorist the President so fervently denounces, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\nAs President, I will impose sanctions against any bank... and any nation... that fails to cooperate in the fight against money laundering. I will insist that the Saudis crack down on charities that funnel funds to terrorists... and on anti-American and anti-Israel hate speech. And I will pursue a plan to make America independent of Mideast oil... so that no country holds our security over a barrel of oil.\nFourth, we will protect the homeland.\nEven as we stay on the offensive against the terrorists, we've got to strengthen our defense.\nFor example, 95 percent of the containers coming into our ports are not screened today. I will change that.\nToday, your luggage is x-rayed when it goes on the plane, but the cargo in the hold underneath is almost never checked. I will change that.\nMore than 2 million rail cars and 500 train stations are used by commuters everyday. Yet, the Department of Homeland Security still has no strategy to defend them...even after the terrorist attacks in Madrid. I will change that.\nHalf our fire-fighters don't have the radios they need to communicate in a crisis. I will change that.\nMore than 100 chemical plants in the United States are located in communities of one million or more people. The President caved to pressure from his big donors and dropped new plant security regulations. I will change that.\nPresident Bush said during the debates that we don't have enough money to do what we must to keep Americans safe because he's determined to hold on to his tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of Americans.\nI will change that, too.\nI will never put a price tag on America's security.\nMy plan will screen more shipping containers and more air cargo for explosives ... invest in rail and subway security... defend our chemical and nuclear plants... increase border security...and give our first responders the equipment and personnel they need to protect America.\nFifth, we will deny the terrorists safe havens and new recruits...and promote freedom and democracy.\nToday, terrorists find sanctuary, support and successors among hundreds of millions of people around the world who live in failing or repressive states... and who have no hope for the future.\nI will refocus our attention and reform our institutions to prevent weak and failing states from becoming terrorist havens. We will lead the world to focus on economic development... debt relief... combating corruption... investing in global education...fighting infectious disease like HIV-AIDS. Each of these tools is a weapon in the war on terrorism.\nI will launch a new era of public diplomacy to explain our policies to the world... and to combat lies and distortions about America.\nAnd I will support the forces of progress in non-democratic countries... not with reckless campaigns to impose democracy by force from the outside... but by working with modernizers from the inside to build the institutions of democracy.\nI believe we can succeed in Iraq and I know we can win the war on terror. We can defeat, capture and kill the terrorists.\nWhat we need is not personal attacks for political advantage, but a capacity to see reality and a real plan for success.\nAs president, I will be resolute in confronting the evil that exists in the world. I will never hesitate to use force to confront and defeat any threat. I will never give any nation or organization a veto over our national security. I will build and lead strong alliances. And I will never forget that, in the end, one of our greatest strengths, one of our greatest safeguards, is that America can be the ideal that inspires others everywhere. If we again become that beacon of hope, we will discover in ourselves the most powerful and useful weapons in the war against the terrorists. Because if we are true to ourselves, we will show the world that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.\nOn the morning of September 11th, Kristen Breitweiser, a wife and mother, didn't think she had a care in the world. But just after 9am, tragedy struck and in an instant, Kristen lost her husband and the father of her children.\nKristen has had the courage to take her unbelievable loss and transform it into an unbending determination to make America safe. She is here today, because she is doing everything we can to advance that cause.\nI want a world where no American mother should have to lie awake at night worrying what tomorrow will bring -- whether her husband will be safe at work or her children will be safe at school the next day. No one should have to fear that students on a graduation trip to our nation's capitol or one of our greatest cities might be attacked.\nOur hope – our determination – is nothing less than this: to live our lives confident that we are safe at home and secure in our world. That is a great issue in this campaign and that is the great victory I will fight for as your President.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-10-20", "title": "Remarks in Waterloo, Iowa"}

Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29745", "text": "Thank you, Dana, for an introduction that means more than I can tell you. And I know that I speak for everyone when I say that you and your family are in our thoughts and prayers.\nChris was my friend and one of the most hopeful people I've ever met. He treated every day like a gift and his life was a gift to us all. He not only showed us what it means never to give up, but he showed us what it means to believe – to seek, to find, and not to yield. His spirit soared even when he could hardly move. His courage, compassion, and determination were an inspiration – and I'm confident that because of him, someday soon millions of Americans will live – and live healthier lives. Chris once said, \"So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.\" Dana, your devotion to Chris and this cause are your own inspiration to all of us. And together, we will make his dream – the dream of so many millions – come true.\nI'm pleased to be back in Columbus today, home to one of the great research universities in the world – Ohio State. And I'm also honored to be joined here today by John and Annie Glenn, who've been my companions for so many months and miles of this campaign. I can't thank them enough.\nWe face a fundamental choice in this election – the choice of a lifetime – and a choice that couldn't be clearer.\nI believe that we need a President who defends America and fights for the middle class.\nWhen I am President, we will make a fresh start in Iraq to bring our allies to our side and train the Iraqis so that we can succeed and bring our troops home. I will fight a tougher, smarter, more effective war on terror. We will hunt down, capture, and kill the terrorists wherever they are.\nI will never give any other nation or organization a veto over our national security. But I will never forget what Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Reagan all knew – that America is stronger, our troops are safer, and success is more certain when we build and lead strong alliances, not when we go it alone.\nBut a President has to be able to do more than one thing at a time. And today, I want to talk about one of the great issues that matter to middle class families: an America that leads the world in science and technology.\nThere is no issue more fundamental to creating the good jobs of the future, curing disease, making America independent of Mideast oil, and educating the next generation of scientists than our investments in science and innovation. As President, I will make science and technology a priority once again.\nFor 225 years, America has been defined by our sense of limitless possibility. We've always approached the future with imagination and dreams. What other nation could dream of flight – and have two bicycle mechanics from Ohio make it happen? What other nation could produce a man like John Glenn – who would help lead us to put the first footprints on the moon and find a path to the stars? What other nation could set out to learn more about disease and illness – and then lead an international coalition to map every single gene in the human body? This state has played an important role in that revolution – everything from the traffic light to the compact disc is a product of Ohio ingenuity.\nBut we haven't just created inventions that changed the world. In the process, we have created millions of well-paying jobs for middle class families here in Ohio and across America. The money we have spent at the federal level on research and development since World War II – working hand in hand with private investment – has been the best jobs program America has ever had. In fact, technology alone has helped account for half of all economic growth here in Ohio since 1945.\nThis hasn't just been a story of scientific imagination, but political imagination – from leaders at every step along the way who recognized that America's leadership in science and technology has given America a competitive edge in the world.\nJohn Kennedy was one of those leaders. Forty-four years ago this week, he came here to Columbus to challenge America to lead the world in science and innovation. The Soviet Union had just become the first country in the world to launch a man into space.\nStanding on the capitol steps, he said, \"We cannot be satisfied as Americans to have the Soviet Union producing twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.\" Later in Dayton, to those who thought America could afford to wait, he said, \"this country cannot settle for being first, if; first, but; first, when; or first, maybe. We need to be first on the far side of the moon and here in this country, and that is the issue.\"\nIn 1962, John Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth. Almost a decade later, another Ohioan, Neil Armstrong, completed that journey to the moon. When John Kennedy came here 44 years ago, America was falling behind in science and technology. Because of his vision, America was number one for decades. Now we are challenged not just by the successes of other countries, but by the failures of our own political leadership.\nOnce again, today America needs a President who believes in science as John Kennedy did. The American people deserve a President who understands that when America invests in science and technology, we can build a stronger economy and create jobs for the 21st Century. But George Bush has turned his back on the spirit of exploration and discovery.\nWe now have a President who is so beholden to special interests that he refuses to make the kinds of investments that benefit our common interests.\nOn one hand, he fights for corporate interests at the expense of the middle class. On the other hand, he has an extreme political agenda that slows instead of advances science.\nIt is wrong to take hope away from people. Hope is what gave us the polio vaccine and other breakthroughs in medicine. It is wrong to tell scientists that they can't cross the frontiers of new knowledge. It is wrong morally and it is wrong economically. When I am president, we will change this policy – and we will lead the world in stem cell research.\nFrom nanotechnology to artificial intelligence, we know where the next generation of high-paying jobs will come from: jobs that pay, on average, 70 percent more than other jobs. Yet, George Bush has been so obsessed with cutting taxes for the wealthy that our investments in creating those jobs are dying on the vine.\nThis President has proposed cutting the National Science Foundation budget for research and development, cutting the EPA research budget, and cutting the Veteran's Affairs research budget. He's proposed cutting the Manufacturing Extension Program that business uses to develop new processes by 90 percent. This week, we learned that America has fallen to 13th in the world in broadband coverage. Broadband is critical to our long-term growth, but this president has proposed cutting the Agriculture Department's Rural Broadband budget, which brings the internet to America's small towns and rural communities.\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science has said that to make good on all his campaign promises, the President would have to cut research funding at 21 of 24 federal agencies. And as the 9th largest recipient today of federal R&D funding among the 50 states, Ohio will be one of the hardest-hit states of all.\nYou get the feeling that if George Bush had been President during other periods in American history, he would have sided with the candle lobby against electricity, the buggy-makers against cars, and typewriter companies against computers.\nDon't just take my word for it. This summer, 48 Nobel Laureates sent an open letter to the American people in which they said of the Administration, \"By reducing funding for scientific research, they are undermining the foundation of America's future.\" These same Nobel Laureates have gone on record as saying the Bush Administration has systematically distorted facts to sustain their extreme positions.\nIn other words, the Administration's approach on scientific research is the same pattern we see in Iraq and on the economy today: if their policy isn't supported by the facts, then they just change the facts.\nUnder this President, America has been losing its lead in science. Our share of industrial patents is down, our share of Nobel prizes is down, our published research is down, and the number of new doctorates in the sciences is down.\nThe rest of the world isn't waiting for us to catch back up. In fact, this year, China and India will graduate 10 times as many engineers as we will have here in the U.S.\nMy friends, there is absolutely no reason why America should fall behind China on anything when it comes to innovation. If Asia can produce more research scientists, so can Ohio. If Tsinghua University can develop the jobs of the future, so can Ohio State. If Bangalore can be completely wired for broadband, then so can Dayton and Columbus.\nThis moment in history is too important -- the opportunities before us are too great – for America to trust a President who doesn't trust science. We need a fresh start on science and innovation. As President, I will see to it that America is once again at the forefront of scientific discovery.\nFirst, we are going to create the well-paying jobs of the future by investing more in areas of research that are likely to create the industries that produce those jobs. Over the past four years, this Administration has lost more than 800,000 technology jobs, many to China and India. To keep and create good jobs here at home, we are going to close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas – and we'll reward companies that create and keep good jobs here at home.\nWe will invest in areas like advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, and nanotechnology that have the potential to improve lives and save them. And because we do not know where the next great breakthroughs will come from, I will support curiosity-driven, high-risk research that has given us such \"accidental\" discoveries as the MRI.\nSecond, we are going to help cure disease by investing in science and new technologies. We will not stand in the way of the future. We will find it. We will lift President Bush's ban on federal funding for stem cell research.\nBy blocking stem cell research, President Bush has sacrificed science to ideology. I agree with leaders from both political parties that stem cell research represents some of the best hopes of humanity. We are going to make funding for this research a priority. And we will uphold the highest ethical standards in the process.\nThird, we are going to make America independent of Mideast oil by investing in the energy technology of the future – in innovations that will create good jobs across America. America once led the world in the production of clean energy products and the payrolls that go with them. We have to do it again – whether it's in wind, solar, ethanol, or clean coal.\nWe'll give automakers tax credits to retool their plants so they can build the fuel-efficient cars of the future, and we'll make sure that alternative energy sources will account for 20 percent of our fuel and 20 percent of our electricity by 2020. We will invest in energy-saving technologies so our homes, businesses, and factories are more efficient. I believe it's high time we had an America that relied on its own energy ingenuity – and not the Saudi Royal Family.\nFourth, we are going to create the workforce of the future by making college more affordable and preparing our workers for tomorrow's economy. If you're a freshman at Ohio State this fall, you are paying 74 percent more -- $3,000 more – than a student who arrived here in 2000. To make college more affordable, we will offer a tax credit on $4,000 of tuition so young Americans can turn their aspirations into achievement.\nTo close the growing skills gap on math and engineering between America and the rest of the world, we will support all-girls math and science schools and special after- school and summer programs that aim to get more girls and minorities engaged in math and science at an early age. We will give colleges new financial incentives to increase the number of science, technology and math majors they graduate, and double the National Science Foundation's graduate scholarships in these fields.\nI am going to be a President who believes in science.\nIn the end, this isn't just about policy, it's about hope. It's about honoring the families here in Ohio who have seen jobs go overseas, and hope somebody is looking out for them. It's about honoring the mothers who want their children to grow up in world where the ground is safe to play on and the air is safe to breath. It's about honoring the hopes of my friend, Chris Reeve.\nChris had an unquenchable belief in the innovation and genius of America. He drew strength from the talent and dedication of scientists he met. And in turn, he inspired them, too – stunning doctors by regaining some sensation over 70 percent of his body and moving most of his joints. He never lost faith that America and American science was the greatest hope for humanity. That's a faith I believe all of us should share, for Chris Reeve, and the millions of people like him who believe in the possibilities of this remarkable time and our remarkable country. Some ask, how can we do it? My question is, how can we commit ourselves to anything less? With your help, that's the kind of President I'll be. I ask for your vote. Together, let's give America back its future and its truth.\nThank you, God Bless you, and God Bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-10-21", "title": "Remarks in Columbus, Ohio"}

Caroline has become a powerful and articulate defender of the bill of rights and she's helped lead the effort to reform New York City's Schools. She understands that every single one of us can make a difference – and she's spending her life making a difference for others.\nMy friends, we face a fundamental choice in this election – the choice of a lifetime – a choice about the character of our country.\nI believe that we need a President who defends America and fights for the middle class.\nWhen I am President, we will make a fresh start in Iraq to bring our allies to our side and train the Iraqis so that we can succeed and bring our troops home. I will fight a tougher, smarter, more effective war on terror. We will hunt down, capture, and kill the terrorists wherever they are.\nI will never give any other nation or organization a veto over our national security. But I will never forget what Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Reagan all knew – that America is stronger, our troops are safer, and success is more certain when we build and lead strong alliances, not when we go it alone.\nBut a President has to be able to do more than one thing at a time. And today, I want to talk about one of the greatest challenges facing the American middle class and those struggling to join it: in today's economy, too many hard-working women are falling further and further behind.\nJust last month, I was talking with a group of folks in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania about lost jobs and rising costs – when a woman in the crowd slowly stood up. She told me that her name was Lori Sheldon, and with tears in her eyes, she said, \"You see those two young ladies over there? Those are my daughters. I'm tired of saying no to them. We say no all the time.\"\nAs I travel across this country, I meet women like Lori every single day. Women squeezed between rising costs and sinking wages who tell me, health care's so expensive, they just can't afford it...gas costs so much, they empty their wallets just to fill their tanks...and year after year, they pay just too much in taxes.\nAnd no matter how hard they work – at their jobs and at home – no one in the White House understands the challenges they face. No matter how tough it gets, no one in the White House seems to be listening. The women I meet – they don't expect the government to do their jobs for them. But they do want leaders who are on their side as they try to do their jobs.\nI'm here today because I hear what women are saying, and I see what's going on. And I pledge to you that if you join with me, I will fight every day so that women like Lori Sheldon can once again start saying yes – yes to themselves, yes to their children, and yes to their hopes for a better future.\nEverywhere I go, I meet women working two jobs, three jobs, just to get by. And that's only counting the jobs they're paid for. After they punch out at work, many punch right back in at home for their next shift as care-giver, meal-cooker, financial-planner, house-cleaner – and all the other jobs they do to help support our families.\nThey work hard every day – and every night – but still, each new day brings a new set of worries.\nYou worry when you hear your son cough in the middle of the night, or when he goes out to play in the morning – because you just can't afford an illness or an accident. And you worry when your parents can't afford their medicine, and you can't afford to help.\nYou and your husband worry at the kitchen table after the kids have gone to bed, when this month's paychecks don't cover last month's bills. And you worry that even if you've had your job for months or for years – you can't be sure you'll have it tomorrow or next month.\nAnd as you tuck your daughter in at night, you worry because you want her to go to college and have all the opportunities in the world -- but you don't know how you'll ever manage to afford it.\nToday, for far too many women, the American Dream seems a million miles away, because when you've barely got time to sleep – who's got time to dream?\nGeorge Bush likes to talk about how being President is \"hard work.\" Mr. President, I'm very happy to relieve you of that hard work. And before the President complains about his job, he ought to come here and spend a day with you. He might learn something about how, day after day, the women of this country juggle so much with such grace and strength. What you do every day – now that's hard work.\nUnfortunately, facing reality isn't exactly this President's strong suit. When confronted with a problem, he's got a simple strategy: Pretend it's all just fine, and hope that no one notices.\nGeorge Bush is the first president in 72 years to lose jobs on his watch. In fact, Wisconsin alone lost 7,000 jobs last month. And, when you add up the numbers, this state hasn't gained a single job in the last four years. Not exactly what I'd call an economic \"recovery.\" And his Administration says it's time to celebrate. Two weeks ago, the President's Treasury Secretary went to Ohio -- where they've lost more than 230,000 jobs -- and told them that those lost jobs were nothing but a \"myth.\" How dare they. Mr. President, the millions of Americans who have lost jobs on your watch are not myths – they're America's middle class families.\nMillions of women struggle to get by on the minimum wage. They have to pay rent, buy groceries, and clothes for their children. But in terms of purchasing power, the minimum wage is the lowest it's been in nearly fifty years. And nearly two and a half million women have fallen into poverty in just the past four years. How dare this administration say this is the best economy of our lifetime?\nToday, whether you're a health care aide, or a sales clerk at a store, a computer technician, or even a top executive, the pay gap between men and women is with you every day. American women continue to make an average of just 76 cents for every dollar earned by men. And George Bush's Chief Economist at the Department of Labor has claimed that the pay gap is \"phony\" and a \"fiction.\" That's outrageous – that in this country, there isn't real equality for women. And when I'm president, we're not going to stand for it.\nWomen across America are living with skyrocketing health costs, and they worry every day about the millions of children who are still uninsured. How dare George W. Bush dismiss this as a \"litany of complaints\"?\nThe simple fact is, this President is just out of touch and out of ideas. He can spin until he's dizzy, but at the end of the day, who does he think American women are going to believe – him or their own eyes?\nThe reason this President doesn't get it is because for his powerful and well-connected friends, it really is the best economy of their lifetime. When he gives tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas, they really do have reason to celebrate. And when he hands Halliburton a $7 billion no-bid contract, well, there isn't any pay gap there.\nPresident Bush talks a lot about an ownership society, and now we know what he means – when it comes to health care, education, and a good standard of living for hard-working women, his answer is: Sorry, you're on your own.\nAnd I think that's one of the biggest differences between George Bush and us. We believe that the middle class is the backbone of this country – and that hard-working women are the bedrock of our families. We believe that women deserve more than false assurances and empty promises from their President. They deserve a fresh start with a President who's going to take responsibility, face reality, and make sure that they don't just get by – they get ahead. If you give me that chance – I will be that President.\nFirst, as President, I'm going to make sure that working women get the wages they've earned – and not a penny less. This President has done just the opposite. George W. Bush turned back the clock on equal pay. And today, the gap between what women and men are earning is actually growing.\nHe keeps standing in the way of a real increase in the minimum wage. And he imposed new rules that take away overtime pay from 6 million workers – including millions of women.\nThat's the wrong choice for women and their families, and we're going to change it.\nWe're going to raise the minimum wage to $7 an hour, so that no woman working full time will have to raise a family while living below the poverty line. That will help more than 9 million women and, for those working full time, it will mean an increase in their incomes of over $3,800 a year. We're also going to create good paying jobs that let families get ahead. We're going to provide real tax cuts for middle class families to put money back in the pockets of hard-working women. We're going to roll back George Bush's overtime pay restrictions. And we'll close the pay gap once and for all – because, in America, equal work should mean equal pay, no, ands, ifs, or buts about it. We're going to shatter the glass ceiling, because in our America, all people are created equal.\nSecond, we'll provide immediate relief to women and families who've been hard hit by soaring health care costs. For the past four years, President Bush has turned a blind eye as premiums went up $3,500, 2 million more women lost their health coverage, and millions of children have just one option for health care: the emergency room in the middle of the night.\nThat's the wrong choice for women and their families, and we're going to change it.\nWe'll cover every child in America by signing them up for health insurance the first time they go to a hospital or on their first day of school. We're going to give all Americans access to the same health plan that members of Congress give themselves: A choice of private health plans that will let you pick your own doctor. And we will guarantee that medical decisions are made by patients and doctors, not by the government, and not by some HMO bureaucrats sitting behind a computer screen thousands of miles away.\nThird, we're going to do everything it takes to provide a quality education for every American child and open the doors of college for every American family. George Bush talks a lot about No Child Left Behind, but what he doesn't tell you is that he's left the funding behind. He doesn't tell you that he's tried to cut afterschool programs for half a million children. He doesn't tell you that he broke his promise and actually cut college aid for millions of students.\nThat's the wrong choice for women and their families, and we're going to change it.\nWe're going to fight to ensure that every child in America goes to a safe, quality school with smaller class sizes, good teachers and high-standards. We'll fully fund No Child Left Behind, and offer three and a half million children the afterschool programs they need to keep them off the streets and out of trouble. In the richest country on earth, it makes no sense to spend $50,000 a year to send a kid to prison for life, when we can spend $10,000 a year on early childhood education, Head Start, Smart Start, the best possible start in life.\nEducational opportunity begins in the early years, but it doesn't end until every child achieves their full potential. We'll offer a tax credit on up to $4,000 of college tuition so that young Americans can turn their aspirations into achievement.\nFinally, we're going to make sure that women get the decent retirement they deserve. More than anyone else, women depend on Social Security. Too often, they have less in savings and less to fall back on – yet they live longer. For them, Social Security is not just a promise, it's a lifeline.\nGeorge Bush's promise was to protect Social Security. But for four years, he's raided the Social Security trust fund to pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. And recently, he said that if he was re-elected, he'd \"come out strong\" to privatize Social Security. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, that means benefit cuts of 25 to 45 percent. But what does it mean for a woman whose only income is a $1100 a month Social Security check? It means cutting more pills in half ... it means not being able to buy a birthday gift for a grandchild ... it means sitting awake at night, often all alone, worrying about what tomorrow will bring. That's the wrong choice for women and seniors – and we're not going to let it happen. The Scripture says honor thy father and mother. So let me state it plainly: I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. And I will not raise the retirement age. Instead, I will restore fiscal responsibility so we can reduce the deficit and save Social Security.\nIn eleven days, we face a fundamental choice. Do we want four more years of a President who's out of touch with women's lives and measures his success by how much he's done for those with the most? Or do we want a fresh start with a President who measures progress by what he's done to help women who work hard at a job – and who work at the most important job of all, raising our children.\nThe choice is in your hands. The women of America can write the future of America if they go to the polls and make their voices heard.\nImagine if the roughly 38 million women who didn't vote in 2000 came together and said: we need a president who's on our side. Imagine 38 million votes for good jobs...38 million votes for quality health care ... 38 million votes for real retirement security ... 38 million votes for a better life for our children.\nThat can be our future – if we choose it. You don't have to settle for more of the same. November 2nd is your chance to move this country in a new direction.\nIt's time for a fresh start for America.\nSo I ask you to give John Edwards and me the chance to fight for you. Give me the chance to make you proud. Give me the chance to lift our country up. Give me the chance to make our country strong. Over the months and miles of this effort, I have met so many of you, listened to you and learned from you. I am honored and humbled to carry your hopes with me in this campaign. And I pledge to you that every day as president, I will take your words, your stories, and your faith in America with me to the Oval Office.\nLet's go out and make it happen!\nThank you, God Bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-10-22", "title": "Remarks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin"}

This is John Kerry.\nJust last month, I was talking with a group of folks in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania about lost jobs and rising costs – when a woman in the crowd slowly stood up. She told me that her name was Lori Sheldon, and with tears in her eyes, she looked at me and said, \"You just told our story. You see those two young ladies over there? Those are my daughters. I'm tired of saying no to them. We say no all the time.\"\nAs I travel across this country, I meet women like Lori every single day. Women who are squeezed between rising costs and sinking wages, and who are falling further and further behind. And the hardest thing is that no matter how tough it gets, no one in the White House seems to be listening.\nWell I want you to know that I see what's going on – and I'm listening to what you're telling me. And with your help, I will fight every day so that women like Lori Sheldon can once again start saying yes – yes to themselves, yes to their children, and yes to their dreams for a better future.\nGeorge Bush likes to talk about how being President is \"hard work.\" Well, before he complains about his job, he ought to spend a day with the women who are struggling hard to get by.\nHe is the first president in 72 years to lose jobs. But his own Treasury Secretary says that job losses are nothing but a \"myth.\"\nFour and a half million women struggle to get by on the minimum wage, and nearly two and a half million have fallen into poverty in just the past four years. And the Bush Administration claims that this is the best economy of our lifetime.\nToday, women continue to make just 76 cents for every dollar earned by men. And George Bush's Chief Economist at the Department of Labor has claimed that the pay gap is \"phony\" and a \"fiction.\"\nMr. President, women worrying when they hear their children cough in the middle of the night because they can't afford health care aren't myths. Women struggling to fill up their grocery carts on $5.15 an hour isn't fiction. And when women put away every dime they can and still don't know if they can send their kids to college, it isn't the best economy of our lifetime. It's reality, and we need a President who's finally willing to face it and do something about it.\nI'll be a president who works for the women of America who work at a job – and who do the most important job of all, raising our children.\nWe will make sure that women get the wages they've earned – and not a penny less. Today, women pay the same amount as men for groceries and rent and health care, but they're still making 24 cents less on the dollar. That's wrong, and when I'm President, we'll fight to close the pay gap once and for all, because equal work deserves equal pay – no ands, ifs, or buts about it.\nWe're going to increase the minimum wage, something George Bush has opposed for four years. Today, there are too many working women being paid the minimum wage who are still living in poverty. That's wrong, and when I'm President, we'll raise it to $7 an hour, giving a financial boost to 9.2 million working women and lifting millions out of poverty. That's a good start -- but we know it's not enough. So we're also going to create good paying jobs that let families get ahead.\nFinally, we're going to roll back George Bush's restrictions that could take overtime pay away from up to 6 million Americans, including millions of women. That's wrong, and when I'm President, we're going to ensure that when you work extra hours, you'll get the extra pay you deserve.\nThis can be our future – if you choose it. This can be our future if you have the hope and belief that America can always do better. This can be our future if we come together, make our voices heard, and believe in ourselves again. And ten days from now, with your help, we'll make sure that our best days are still ahead of us.\nThanks for listening.", "timestamp": "2004-10-23", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29748", "text": "America has always been driven by one powerful idea: with hard work and a moral compass, we can give our children a better life. Our economy and even more, our society, are built on that basic compact.\nAnd that compact goes all the way back to the moral teachings of the great preachers and educators who taught the founders of our nation to believe that we could create a great and shining City on a Hill here in America.\nNot long ago, that middle-class dream was within reach of all those willing to work for it. But today, America's great middle class is in danger because of leadership that doesn't share their values and won't fight for their way of life.\nTell me this: Is it worthy of the good society to, not once, not twice, but three times deny health care to millions of children while giving tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans – those who earn more than $200,000 a year?\nAre we living up to our values when we pass on the costs of a war to future generations instead of asking the wealthiest among us to bear a measure of the wartime sacrifice?\nAre we living up to our values when government creates deficits so massive that they threaten the Social Security on which millions of our seniors depend for dignity and decency in their retirement?\nHow can we accept anyone breaking the fundamental compact with those who worked all their lives, raised our families, defended our nation, and lifted America to a place in the world never known before?\nAre we living up to our values – are we serving the common good – by rewarding companies for shipping jobs overseas?\nFor me, this campaign is about more than a set of policies; it is about a set of ideals: fairness and opportunity, stewardship and community, concern for the middle class and the poor, and the on-going struggle for the security of our nation and a more peaceful world.\nSo today, I want to share with you my vision for America and the values that inspire it. For months now, you have heard President Bush and me debate the critical foreign and domestic challenges before us. There are clear differences between us. And while I am convinced that I offer the new direction and the fresh start America needs at this critical moment, today I want to talk about the foundations of belief and commitment that brought me to public service, that have sustained me in the best and worst of times, and that I will carry with me everyday as president.\nIt all began with my parents who, in addition to making sure I learned and lived my faith, also taught me at an early age that we are all put on this earth for something greater than ourselves. What they taught me was truly put to the test when I was in Vietnam. Faith was as much a part of our daily lives as the battle itself. Some of my closest friends were killed. I prayed. And I even questioned how all the terrible things I'd seen fit into God's plan.\nBut I got through it. I came home with a sense of hope and a belief in a higher purpose. For more than 30 years, as a soldier, a prosecutor, a senator, and now as a candidate for president, I have tried to live that belief. And for the past two years, I have had the privilege of meeting people like you all across this land -- people who love their families, love their country, and are determined to build a better life for their kids. The single mother who lies awake worrying that her child's health care might cost more than she makes in a month. Moms and dads who save and save and still come up short when they get a bill for college or child care that's higher than they thought. The families hoping and praying that loved ones serving our country a world away will be safe in battle and soon return home. The factory workers whose jobs were sent overseas and who now have to take two jobs just to earn what they used to make.\nIn the Book of James we are taught: \"It is not enough, my brother to say you have faith when there are no deeds...Faith without works is dead.\"\nFor me, that means having and holding to a vision of a society of the common good, where individual rights and freedoms are connected to our responsibility to others. It means understanding that the authentic role of leadership is to advance the liberty of each of us and the good that can come to all of us, when we work together as one united community.\nCatholics call this solidarity. We simply mean that as children of the same God, we share a common destiny. We express our humanity by reaching out to our fellow citizens, and indeed, to all our brothers and sisters in this country and on this earth. It means that the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties are not felt in isolation, they are shared by all. The anxieties of hard-pressed families are as much in our hearts as those who enjoy much more comfort.\nThose values will guide me as president. I will put middle class families and those struggling to join them ahead of the interests of the well-to-do and the well-connected. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with success. But if we mean what we say when we talk about lifting up the good society, then we have an obligation to give everyone the chance to succeed.\nIt's time to stop making middle-class families work harder for less while paying more and more for health care, college, and all the necessities of life.\nMy faith, and the faith I have seen in the lives of so many Americans, also teaches me that, \"Whatever you do to the least of these, you do unto me.\" That means we have a moral obligation to one another, to the forgotten, and to those who live in the shadows. This is a moral obligation at the heart of all our great religious traditions. It is also the vision of America: \"E Pluribus Unum.\" The ethical test of a good society is how it treats its most vulnerable members.\nWho among us is more vulnerable today than the 8 million Americans who are out of work? Who is more vulnerable than the 45 million Americans without health insurance? Who is more vulnerable than the parents who have to choose between food and medicine for their children? Older Americans – our parents and grandparents – should not have to take bus trips to Canada to afford the medicines they need to live -- and live healthy lives. No mother who gets up and goes to work every day should have to raise her children in poverty. That's why we have to raise the minimum wage, ensure equal pay, and finish the job of welfare reform, so we can honor work and once again grow the middle class instead of growing the number of people in poverty.\nThe Bible tells us that in others we encounter the face of God: \"I was hungry and you fed me; thirsty and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger and you received me in your homes; naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you took care of me. I was in prison and you visited me.\" This is the final judgment of who we are and what our life will mean.\nI believe we must keep faith, not only with the Creator, but also with present and future generations.\nWill we leave as our legacy a polluted land or will we pass on to generations to come a land that truly can be called America the beautiful?\nWill we take action now to cut the cost of energy so that already overburdened seniors in the colder parts of our country can afford heat in the winter – and here in Florida, stay cool and healthy in the heat of summer?\nAnd, let me say for Americans -- and I would venture to say for people all across this earth -- that there is no higher duty today than to defeat terrorism so, we can raise our children in security and peace.\nThis is the great test of our time. We pray for the brave Americans in uniform who are on the frontlines of that battle. I was one of those troops once – and I can tell you that those prayers matter.\nBut justice and lasting peace require the strength of our ideals as well as the strength of our arms. We must build and lead strong alliances – not just for defense, but for progress against the other common enemies of humanity – hopelessness, hatred, and disease. We need a president who knows how to win the war – and win the peace. And then we need to join with others to be true peacekeepers – whether the issue is ending the scourge of HIV-AIDs here and around this planet, draining the swamps in which terrorism breeds, or shaping a world where one-half of the world's children are no longer ill-housed, ill-fed, and ill-educated.\nBut none of this will happen unless we come together as One America. An America that puts the politics of polarization behind us. An America that honors the truth that what unites us is stronger than what divides us. An America that understands that there is something for everyone single one of us to do – and challenges each of us to try.\nI have tried and so much of that effort has been nourished by my faith. I know there are some Bishops who have suggested that as a public official I must cast votes or take public positions – on issues like a woman's right to choose and stem cell research – that carry out the tenets of the Catholic Church. I love my Church; I respect the Bishops; but I respectfully disagree.\nMy task, as I see it, is not to write every doctrine into law. That is not possible or right in a pluralistic society. But my faith does give me values to live by and apply to the decisions I make.\nIn nine days, Americans will make their decision. How will we find our way forward? My answer is: Move our economy, our government, and our society back in line with our highest values. Hard-working families do right by their country every day. They deserve a country that will do right by them.\nMy faith gives me hope that we will come together and rise to that challenge. I believe we will find the strength to live out the words of President Kennedy that, \"Here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own.\"\nThis isn't about being a Democrat or a Republican. It's about bringing Democrats and Republicans together for a higher purpose. It's about the principles that have made America a land of opportunity and compassion -- and a beacon to all the world. It's about that dream of \"liberty and justice for all\" – the vision that defines our destiny and our mission. We will never fully finish that journey – not on this earth. But let us move forward with a strong and active faith. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side.\nSo I ask all of you – Republicans and Democrats, progressives and conservatives, faithful and less faithful – to pray together that God guide this nation in the decision we make nine days from now.\nWe will elect a president. Whether it is me or George Bush, we will both be in need of your prayers and your support. And pray also that our president will help make this a more secure and peaceful world and lead us on our next step in America's journey to that shining city on a hill.\nWe always end our speeches in campaigns like this by saying \"God bless America.\" But it seems to me that we should also say to God, \"Thank you for blessing America in so many ways.\"\nMay America always have God's blessing.", "timestamp": "2004-10-24", "title": "Remarks at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts in Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29749", "text": "Thank you Wisconsin. And thank you UWGB – it's great to be here at the home of the Phoenix.\nI want to start by thanking all the mayors who made the trip to be here with me. Every day, America's mayors find themselves on the frontlines of the fight to secure America. They know better than anyone the challenges we face to keep our cities prepared. In the three years since September 11th, you have done a magnificent job. And today, I'd like to talk about how much safer we can be if we have a President who did his job as well as you do yours.\nOne week from today, America faces a fundamental choice – the choice of a lifetime – a choice about the future of our country.\nI believe that we need a President who defends America and fights for the middle class.\nWhen I am President, I will fight a tougher, smarter, more effective war on terror. We will hunt down, capture, and kill the terrorists wherever they are.\nI will never give any other nation or organization a veto over our national security. But I will never forget what Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Reagan all knew – that America is stronger, our troops are safer, and success is more certain when we build and lead strong alliances, not when we go it alone.\nGeorge Bush has failed to learn this lesson. And over the last four years, he has failed in his fundamental obligation as Commander-in-Chief to make America as safe and secure as we should be.\nYesterday, we learned that nearly 380 tons of powerful conventional explosives vanished from one of Iraq's most sensitive military installations, after the invasion.\nJust as the Bush Administration's failure to secure Iraq's borders has led to thousands of terrorists flooding into the country, their failure to secure those explosives threatens American troops and the American people.\nBefore the war, the explosives were monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which warned the Bush Administration that they could fall into the wrong hands. And it urged the Bush Administration to secure them.\nBut we rushed to war in Iraq without a plan to safeguard sensitive sites like this one.\nAnd now, the explosives are missing, unaccounted for, and could be in the hands of terrorists – used to attack our troops or our people.\nAs a result of this loss, terrorists could be helping themselves to what has been called \"the greatest explosives bonanza in history.\"\nNo wonder the president thinks whether were going to be safe is \"up in the air.\"\nThese explosives... HMX and RDX... could produce bombs powerful enough to demolish entire buildings... blow up airplanes... destroy tanks... and kill our troops. Terrorists used RDX to take down Pan Am 103 and Al Qaeda used it to attack the USS Cole.\nFaced with these devastating facts, what did the President do? First he tried to hide the information until after the election. He has stood in front of the American people day after day, telling us how much progress we are making in Iraq and how much safer we are under his leadership, without ever mentioning the loss of these deadly explosives.\nAnd when the media reported the loss, what did the White House have to say? First, they said they couldn't guard the weapons caches because they had other priorities. Those priorities, according to the White House officials, were Iraqi government buildings, the oil ministry, and the office of reconstruction. Then they argued that losing the explosives wasn't really that big a deal. Finally, at the end of the day, the White House boldly declared that it just didn't happen. Without a shred of evidence to dispute the IAEA, they flatly said the weapons were gone by the time our troops got there.\nAnd what did the president have to say about the missing explosives? Not a word. Complete silence. Despite devastating evidence that his administration's failure here has put our troops and our citizens are in greater danger, George Bush has not offered a single word of explanation. His silence confirms what I have been saying for months: President Bush rushed to war without a plan to win the peace. He didn't have enough troops on the ground to get the job done. He didn't have enough allies to get the job done. He failed to secure Iraq and keep it from becoming what it is today – a haven for terrorists.\nAnd now this morning, we learned that the president wants an additional $70 billion early next year for Iraq and Afghanistan – bringing the total cost to nearly $225 billion. This is the incredible price of going it almost alone in Iraq.\nMr. President, what else are you being silent about? What else are you keeping from the American people? How much more will the American people have to pay?\nThe American people deserve a commander in chief who will tell the truth in good times and bad. This president has failed that fundamental test.\nWhen the President is faced with the consequences of his own wrong decisions, he doesn't confront them, he tries to hide them.\nThe truth is, President Bush has never leveled with the American people about why we went to war... how the war is going... or what he is doing to put Iraq on track.\nThe President diverted critical military and intelligence personnel from Afghanistan and the hunt for Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. He failed to use the best mountain troops in the world when we had bin Laden cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora. Instead, he used Afghan warlords who one week earlier were on the other side.\nThis critical error in judgment allowed Osama to got away. And now, al Qaeda has spread to more than 60 countries... and its operatives have forged new ties to another 20 extremist groups in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Global terrorism is increasing, not receding.\nWhen a Commander-in-Chief makes the wrong decisions, America's security pays the price.\nAfter the invasion, the President's hand picked man in Baghdad, Paul Bremer, told him we didn't have enough troops in Iraq to prevent looting and crime... to secure Iraq's borders against terrorist infiltration... and to guard more than one million tons of ammunition and weapons that could wind up in the hands of the insurgents and be used against our troops.\nThe President's top commander in Iraq, General Sanchez, pleaded with the Administration for critical supplies to counter the growing insurgency, including 36,000 sets of body armor... and spare parts for our tanks, helicopters and fighting vehicles.\nWhen a Commander-in-Chief makes the wrong decision, America's security pays the price.\nThe President's Central Intelligence Agency warned him this summer that the situation in Iraq was bad and getting worse. But the President just kept telling the American people that \"his strategy is succeeding.\"\nSince then, the coalition has lost control of areas where at least 1 million Iraqis live. U.S. forces are attacked an average of 87 times a day – up 100% since the spring. Over 150 foreigners have been kidnapped in Iraq since March.\nWhen a Commander-in-Chief makes the wrong decision, America's security pays the price.\nYesterday, we saw again just how out of touch this administration is. Vice President Cheney called the Iraq war a \"remarkable success story.\" They don't see it; they don't get it; they can't fix it. All George Bush offers is more of the same.\nMr. President, these aren't accounting errors. These are fundamental errors of judgment. Being president is about making the right decisions. Time and again, this president has made the wrong decisions. Time and again, he has chosen the wrong path.\nIn virtually everything he has said... and everything he has done... the President has demonstrated to the American people... and to countries around the world... that he is divorced from reality in Iraq.\nIf President Bush can't recognize the problems in Iraq, he won't fix them.\nI can and I will.\nIt's time for a fresh start in Iraq:\n* To bring our allies to the table.\n* To train Iraqis quickly and effectively so we can bring our troops home.\n* To use reconstruction money to benefit the Iraqi people, not Halliburton.\n* To hold the promised elections early next year.\nWe can succeed in Iraq – but only with new leadership and credibility.\nThe truth is, George Bush has not only made America less secure with his mistakes in Iraq; he's also failed in his obligation to protect the American people at home.\nThree years after the deadliest attack in our nation's history, George Bush still hasn't done what's necessary to protect America because he's too busy protecting his tax cuts for the wealthy and the well-connected.\nJust as he has been warned about his mistakes in Iraq, George Bush has been warned time and time again about the vulnerability of our homeland security: by Republicans and Democrats in Congress, by the 9/11 commission, by the FBI, by the CIA, by his own Justice Department, by his own Homeland Security department, by the Coast Guard, by the border patrol, and by mayors, firefighters, police officers, and emergency responders like those here with us today.\nAnd after you and all of them told this president that we had to do better and do more on homeland security, what was his answer when I brought it up during our debate?\nHe said, \"I don't think we want to get to how he's going to pay for all these promises.\"\nThis from the man who found a way to pay for $89 billion in tax cuts for people who make over $1.2 million – enough to nearly double what we're spending right now on homeland security. This from the man who thinks we can afford to shell out billions of dollars a year to corporations that put mailboxes in the Caribbean to avoid paying taxes.\nWe don't need a President who thinks we can't afford to fund homeland security, we need a President who believes we can't afford not to. And that's the kind of President I will be.\nJust think about the state of our homeland security today:\nThere are over 100 chemical plants near communities of over one million. We know that the EPA and the Justice Department say they're vulnerable to attack. And a Georgia Pacific's former security chief has said that \"Security at a 7-Eleven after midnight is better than at a plant with a 90-ton vessel of chlorine.\"\nBut George Bush has opposed common sense regulations to improve security at our chemical and nuclear plants, giving in to demands from his chemical and nuclear industry campaign contributors. That's wrong, and we're going to change it.\nToday, our borders remain unsecured. Three million people without the proper documentation will enter our country this year – 4,000 every day on the Arizona-Mexico border alone. We've already caught individuals from countries like Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan attempting to cross our borders illegally.\nYet border inspectors tell us they lack the basic training and ready access to information they need to keep terrorists out – like the terrorist watch list. Robert Bonner, the President's own Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, calls the border situation \"a complete mess.\"\nBut George Bush still hasn't created a single integrated watch list. And he is actually cutting jobs in our border patrol. You can't control a border unless it's patrolled.\nTom Ridge has admitted that 95% of the 20,000 containers arriving in America's ports each day are not physically inspected. But George Bush didn't request one dime to enhance our port security until Congress forced him to include it in the budget.\nThe FBI warns us that Al Qaeda may attack trains or subways here as they did in Madrid. But George Bush hasn't asked Congress for one dime to strengthen our public transportation system. That's wrong, and we're going to change it.\nThe Department of Homeland Security's own investigators were able to carry explosives and weapons past security screeners at every airport they visited. But George Bush has allowed thousands of airport screeners to be cut and he won't give airports the funding they need to improve baggage screening. That's wrong, and we're going to change it.\nThe government's own watchdogs tell us that our hospitals are not prepared to deal with a bioterror attack. And, despite pledging to maintain stockpiles of drugs to protect America from a bioterrorism attack, this Administration only has enough licensed anthrax vaccine for 530 people. That's wrong, and we're going to change it.\nHalf of our fire-fighters don't have the radios they need to communicate in a crisis. And the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that 76 percent of cities have still not received first responder funds. But George Bush has cut first responder training and assistance by nearly half in this year's budget. He cut resources for equipment and personnel to local fire departments. And he has consistently cut the COPS program that put 100,000 new police officers on the street. That's wrong, and we're going to change it.\nJust think about what this President has done to our security. Even as he told us we can't afford more port security, more baggage security, more border patrol agents, more firefighters and more cops...George Bush tells America that we can afford every single dime of the $89 billion in tax cuts he gave to folks making more than $1.2 million a year. That's wrong, and we're going to change it.\nThrough the mistakes and misjudgments he has made in Iraq and at home, George Bush has failed to keep the American people as safe and secure as we should be.\nMy fellow Americans, I defended this country as a young man, and I will defend it as President. My highest obligation will be to protect the American people, and I won't let anything get in the way.\nI will invest at least $60 billion more over the next ten years to protect America. I will secure our ports and our borders by screening cargo for nuclear materials. I will make sure that we have enough border agents with the right technology to keep commerce flowing in while keeping terrorists out. And I will make sure we have a single, effective, and integrated terrorist watch list that is accessible to everyone who needs it to keep America safe.\nI will protect our transportation systems by making sure we screen airplane cargo just like we screen baggage; by ensuring our airports have enough trained staff to protect us; by investing more than $2 billion to improve security on our railroads, subways, bridges and tunnels.\nI will protect our chemical and nuclear plants by requiring them to develop and implement real security plans.\nI will protect our country against bioterrorism by making investments in our public health system to detect possible threats; by giving hospitals and emergency rooms the resources they need to contain an attack; and by making sure our public health system can develop and distribute enough vaccines for the people who need them.\nAnd I will always make it my job to do everything possible so that America's first responders – America's heroes – can do theirs. We will invest in more manpower, more equipment, and more training for those who are on the frontlines defending America every day. We will restore funding for the COPS program. I will add 100,000 firefighters. And I will relieve the burden that this President has placed on our National Guard so that they can better fulfill one of their other missions -- to defend our homeland.\nWe have a lot of catching up to do; we need to begin now. We have to fix the problems and close the gaps that George Bush has left in our homeland security. We have to build an America that is safer and stronger.\nIn the past few months, I've been blessed and honored to receive the support of five women who lost their husbands on September 11th. These women fought tirelessly for the creation of the 9/11 commission to find the truth and to ensure that no other families have to suffer the pain that they have endured.\nOn the morning of September 11th, Kristen Breitweiser, a wife and mother, didn't think she had a care in the world. But just after 9am, tragedy struck and in an instant, Kristen lost her husband and the father of her children.\nKristen has had the courage to take her unbelievable loss and transform it into an unbending determination to make America safe.\nI want a world where no American mother should have to lie awake at night worrying what tomorrow will bring -- whether her husband will be safe at work or her children will be safe at school the next day. No one should have to fear that students on a graduation trip to our nation's capitol or one of our greatest cities might be attacked. I ask for your help – Republicans and Democrats and Independents. Let's unite America to make our country safer.\nOur hope – our determination – is nothing less than this: to live our lives confident that we are safe at home and secure in our world. That is a great issue in this campaign and that is the great victory I will fight for as your President.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-10-26", "title": "Remarks at the University of Wisconsin in Green Bay"}
{"author": "John F. Kerry", "category": "campaign speeches and remarks", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29750", "text": "Thank you Sioux City. It's great to be here at North High School with all you Stars!\nOn Tuesday, the American people face a fundamental choice – the choice of a lifetime – a choice about the future of our country.\nWhen I am President, I will fight a tougher, smarter, more effective war on terror. We will hunt down, capture, and kill the terrorists wherever they are.\nI will never give any other nation or organization a veto over our national security. But I will never forget what Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Reagan all knew – that America is stronger, our troops are safer, and success is more certain when we build and lead strong alliances, not when we go it alone.\nGeorge Bush has failed to learn this lesson. And he has failed in his fundamental obligation as Commander-in-Chief to make America as safe and secure as we should be.\nThis morning, we learned more disturbing news about the disappearance of 380 tons of powerful explosives in Iraq. We already know these weapons could produce bombs that can demolish entire buildings... blow up airplanes... destroy tanks... and kill our troops. Terrorists used explosives like this to take down Pan Am 103 and al Qaeda used it to attack the USS Cole. The missing explosives could very likely be in the hands of terrorists and insurgents – who are attacking our forces nearly 90 times a day in Iraq.\nBut now we've learned even more. We're seeing this White House dodge and bob and weave in their usual effort to avoid responsibility -- just as they've done each step of the way in our involvement in Iraq.\nInstead of coming clean with the American people, the administration blamed the bad news on the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.S. military -- and even the media. And all the while, took no responsibility for creating the situation where these weapons could go missing in the first place.\nThe Bush Administration first tried to convince the American people that this was not a big deal -- not a big deal that 380 tons of high grade explosives were now likely in the hands of terrorists and insurgents. Then, White House officials said guarding explosive dumps was not a high priority -- but guarding the Iraqi Oil Ministry apparently was. As more information was revealed in the press, the White House switched to their most comfortable position – the situation was bad but it was not their responsibility. Vice President Cheney, who is becoming the Chief Minister of Disinformation, echoed that it's not the administration's fault and even criticized those who raised the subject. This is a growing scandal and the American people deserve a full and honest explanation of how it happened and what this president is going to do about it.\nAs more facts have emerged, we've learned just how disingenuous the White House has become. Here are the facts. The IAEA warned the Bush Administration and the UN Security Council before the war that this weapons site was critical and needed urgent protection. The US Commander who reached the sight was never told to stop, inspect and protect it. He was never even told what it was.\nColonel Joseph Anderson, commander of the Army's 101st Airborne Division said: \"I didn't know what the place was supposed to be. It was not our mission. It was not our focus. We were just stopping there on our way to Baghdad.\" The troops did their job. The commander in chief failed to do his. The troops did their job -- but the Bush Administration failed to tell them what they already knew and international agencies already knew: this site contained some of the largest quantities of the most dangerous explosives in Iraq. And the reason they failed is because they didn't plan and they rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.\nAnd what do we now hear from this President on this important matter of national security? Silence...not a word...not a single explanation of how this could have happened and or what the U.S. government is doing to address it. That's not leadership. It's not how the commander in chief is supposed to lead. It's not what our troops on the ground deserve.\nThis President says he can't think of a single mistake he's made and he would do everything again in Iraq exactly the same all over again.\nThree hundred and eighty tons of explosives that could be in the hands of terrorists and he would do everything exactly the same? On Iraq, the President doesn't see it, he doesn't get it, and he can't fix it. Exactly the same?\nBorders porous with terrorists pouring in -- and he would do everything exactly the same? Sending our troops to war without body armor -- and he would do everything exactly the same? He says he's doing \"whatever it takes.\" In fact, he consistently takes us in the wrong direction. And he's doomed to repeat the same mistakes all over again.\nThis is an urgent issue and I believe we need a fresh start in Iraq. But I also believe that a president has to be able to do more than one thing at a time. We need a president who will defend America and fight for the middle class.\nPresident Bush doesn't seem to think this is possible. I do.\nAfter four years in office, this President has failed middle-class families with almost every choice he's made. He's given more to those with the most at the expense of middle-class working families who are struggling to get ahead. Now he's asking you to give him four more years so that he can keep up the bad work.\nThe good news is, when you cast your ballot on Tuesday, you don't have to give him that chance.\nYou can choose a fresh start for America. You can choose a President who will fight for the great middle-class and those struggling to join it. And if you give me the opportunity, I will be that President.\nWe need a fresh start. Because the truth is, middle-class families can't afford four years of a Bush economy.\nToo many jobs are being shipped overseas, and the ones that replace them often don't pay enough to make ends meet. Our economy is losing high-paying, middle-class jobs and creating more temporary and part-time jobs without benefits. The middle-class is carrying a larger share of the tax burden, but family income is down, and the cost of everything is through the roof. Health care up 64 percent. College tuition up more than 35 percent. Medicare premiums up 56 percent. 1.6 million lost jobs, 5 million more Americans without health care, and 220,000 students who can't afford college.\nThese aren't just statistics; they're the stories of families I've met all across America. The single mother who lies awake worrying that a child might get sick, and the health care will cost more than she makes in a month. Moms and dads who save and save and still come up short when they get a bill for tuition or child care that's higher than they thought. The factory worker whose job was sent overseas and now has to take two jobs just to earn what he used to make.\nYou know, the President likes to run around the country telling you how his job's been hard work. How he's had to put up with corporate scandals and a tough economy and a weak stock market over the last four years. He likes to tell us how hard it's been for him. Well you know what? We need a President who understands how hard it is on you, not him.\nHe says the presidency is \"hard work, hard work, hard work.\" Well, Mr. President, I'm ready – and impatient -- to relieve you of that hard work.\nOf course, the reason the President doesn't get it is because for the powerful and well-connected friends he's spent four years helping, it really has been the best economy of their lifetime. When he handed Halliburton a $7 billion no-bid contract, they really did have reason to celebrate. When he gave tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas, and helped big agribusiness at the expense of small family farmers, it really was good for them. And when his Medicare bill gave the prescription drug companies a $139 billion in windfall profits, well, it doesn't get much better than that.\nThis is who George Bush fights for. And this is George Bush's record.\nBut it doesn't have to be our future. Because our moment to choose is now.\nDo we want four more years of a President who gives more to those with the most and tells a struggling middle-class that everything's just fine? Or do we want a President who will honor middle-class values and fight for middle-class opportunities?\nDo we want four more years of a President who fights for the privileged few or do we want a President who fights for a stronger America for every American?\nNext Tuesday, this is the choice you will make.\nWhen you wake up next Tuesday morning, your future is on the ballot.\nJobs are on the ballot: George Bush wants to give you four more years of rewarding companies who ship jobs overseas. Four more years of jobs that pay $9000 less than the ones they replaced. Four more years of rising profits for the privileged and falling wages for our families. My fellow Americans, do you want four more years of all that?\nOr do you want a fresh start on jobs? As President, I will fight for good jobs with decent benefits that pay you more so you can pay your bills and build a decent life. We'll begin by closing the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas. Instead, we'll reward the companies that create and keep good jobs here in the United States of America. And to focus on the special challenges facing family farmers and small town Americans, I will hold a Rural Summit in Ames in my first 100 days.\nWhen you head to your polling places on Tuesday, health care is on the ballot: George Bush wants to give you four more years of windfall profits for the big drug companies and the big HMOs. Four more years of rising health care costs and fewer people with health insurance. Four more years of stopping our own government from negotiating for lower drug prices for seniors. My fellow Americans, do you want four more years of all that?\nOr do you want a fresh start on health care? As President, I will finally get the cost of health care under control. We will cover all children in America. We will give families access to the same private health insurance that members of Congress give themselves. We will put medical decisions in the hands of the doctors and patients – not insurance company bureaucrats. And we will finally make health care a right, and not a privilege, for every American.\nWhen you cast your vote this year, taxes are on the ballot: George Bush wants to give you four more years of tax giveaways for millionaires and a higher tax burden for you. Four more years of letting big corporations get away without paying any taxes while you pay more for health care, tuition, and childcare. My fellow Americans, do you want four more years of all that?\nOr do you want a fresh start on taxes? As President, I will cut middle-class taxes so that we can raise middle-class incomes. We'll provide tax cuts for to help you pay for college, health care, and child care. We'll roll back the Bush tax cuts for individuals who make more than $200,000 a year. And the rest of America will get the tax cut that middle-class families deserve.\nWhen you walk into that voting booth, Social Security is on the ballot: George Bush wants four more years of raiding your Social Security trust fund to pay for his massive tax cuts for the wealthy. Four more years of trying to sell you on the same old plan to privatize Social Security and cut your benefits. My fellow Americans, do you want four more years of all that?\nOr do you want a fresh start on Social Security? I will restore fiscal responsibility as president. As President, I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. I will not raise the retirement age. Because when you've worked for a lifetime, America owes you what you've earned.\nLadies and Gentlemen, when you wake up Tuesday morning, your future is on the ballot.\nAnd you will have a choice.\nMy fellow Americans, are you going to choose four more years of the Bush plan to keep sending jobs overseas, or the Kerry plan to create good jobs right here in America?\nAre you going to choose four more years of the Bush plan to keep health care as a privilege for the elected and the connected and the wealthy, or the Kerry plan to make health care affordable and available to all Americans?\nAre you going to choose four more years of the Bush plan to give billions in tax breaks to millionaires, or the Kerry plan to give middle-class families a tax cut on child care, health care, and college tuition?\nAre you going to choose four more years of the Bush plan to privatize Social Security and cut your benefits, or the Kerry plan to keep America's promise to our seniors, and our children, and our grandchildren?\nAre you going to choose four more years of the Bush plan to outsource our energy policy to Exxon and the Saudi Royal Family, or the Kerry plan to make sure that our sons and daughters are never held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East?\nMy fellow Americans, are you going to choose four more years of the same old Bush plan to keep fighting for those with the most and leaving everyone else behind, or the Kerry plan to lift up our middle-class families and bring back the American Dream?\nLadies and Gentlemen, this is the most important election of our lifetime.\nWhen you make your choice about who will lead this country over the next four years, you're not just choosing a President. You're choosing a future for America. And if you give me the privilege of leading us toward that future, I will never stop fighting to bring back hope for the millions of hardworking Americans who believe in their hearts that tomorrow can be better than today.\nMy opponent wants you to vote your fears. I ask you to vote your hopes.\nMy opponent is offering four more years of the same failed policies and failed judgments. I'm offering a fresh start for all Americans.\nI will be a president who unites our country, Democrats and Republicans and independents, to do what's right: Restore an America with a strong middle-class where everyone has the chance to work and the opportunity to get ahead.\nI see a nation of rising opportunity. I believe hope, not fear is our future.\nA woman in Ohio said something about a month ago. I didn't get to meet her, but she grabbed one of my people at the end of an event and she said: \"You be sure to get a hold of the Senator and give him this message for me.\" And the message was, \"Senator, we've got your back!\"\nGive me the chance to make you proud. Give me the chance to lift our country up. And every day I'll look you in the eye and be able to say, \"I've got your back!\" Let's go out and make it happen!

It's great to be back in Orlando.\nFour days from now, Americans will face a choice.\nHow will we find our way forward? How will we keep America safe, and keep the American Dream alive?\nI believe we begin by giving this country we love a fresh start. This morning, I would like to give you as a plainly as I can the summary of my case on how вЂ“ together вЂ“ we can change America.\nI believe we begin by moving our economy, our government, and our society back in line with our best values.\nI believe we begin by doing whatever it takes to lead our troops to success and bring them home safe. And when they do come home, I believe we begin by rebuilding an America with a strong middle-class where everyone has the chance to work and the opportunity to get ahead.\nMy friends, after the many long months and miles of this campaign, in four days this election will be in your hands.\nIn four days, a father will check in at his polling place and think about the family waiting for him to come home for dinner. His job has been outsourced and his new job doesn't pay the bills like his old one did. He'll wonder what they'll do if the kids get sick. And he'll wonder whether we can afford four more years of a President who fights for those at the top while telling everyone else that this is the best economy of our lifetime.\nBut on Tuesday, you have the choice to give that father hope. You have the choice to give the American economy a fresh start.\nIn four days, a young woman will pick up her ballot and think about her future. She'll wonder whether she'll be able to find a good job that will pay off her college loans. She'll wonder how you juggle work and family and why no matter how hard she works she seems to fall further behind. She'll wonder whether we can afford four more years of a President who calls concerns like these nothing more than a litany of complaints.\nBut on Tuesday, you have the choice to give her hope. You have the choice to give young people all across America a fresh start on their future.\nIn four days, a woman will walk into a voting booth thinking about the husband she said goodbye to so many months ago. She'll wonder how much longer he'll have to stay in Iraq, and when she'll see him again. And she will wonder whether we can afford four more years of a President who's unwilling to admit the mistakes he has made, and says he would do everything all over again exactly the same.\nBut on Tuesday, you have the choice to give her hope. You have the choice to give America a fresh start in Iraq.\nMy friends, this is the most important election of our lifetime. And that's not something I'm telling you, that's something you've told me time and time again in this campaign. And when you go into that voting booth you will face a fundamental choice: do we want four more years of the same failed course? Or do we want a fresh start for America?\nBy now, it is clear that no matter who tells him, no matter how many times he hears it, and no matter how bad things get, George W. Bush just doesn't understand the problems facing America.\nIn Iraq, every day, every headline, has brought fresh evidence that our Commander-in-Chief doesn't see what's happening -- isn't leveling with the American people about why we went to war in Iraq...how the war is going вЂ“ and has no idea how to put our policy back on track. His mistakes and misjudgments have hurt our troops, driven away allies, diverted our focus from Osama bin Laden and the real war on terror.\nAt home, George Bush looks at lost jobs, falling wages, and rising costs and tells struggling middle-class families that everything's just fine. That's because for the powerful and well-connected friends he's spent the last four years fighting for, it really is the best economy of their lifetime. And now he's asking us to give him another four years so that he can keep giving them more of the same.\nThis is George Bush's record. But it doesn't have to be our future.\nIn four days, you can choose a fresh start. You can choose a President who will defend America and fight for the middle-class. And if you give me the chance, I will be that President.\nThis is the choice we face on Tuesday.\nIn this election, the safety of the American people is on the ballot.\nOur troops in Iraq are doing a heroic job вЂ“ the problem is our commander in chief isn't doing his.\nThe President tells us that in Iraq, his \"strategy is succeeding.\" The Vice President tells us that the war is a \"remarkable success story.\" But every day on our TV screens, we see the hard truths. We see the consequences of this President's decision to rush to war without a plan to win the peace:\nThe loss of over 1,100 of our brave men and women in uniform. A cost of $225 billion with billions more on the way. Entire regions controlled by insurgents and terrorists.\nBy pushing our allies aside, George Bush's catastrophic mismanagement of this war has left America to bear almost 90% of the costs and 90% of the coalition casualties. We relied on Afghan warlords instead of American troops to hunt down Osama bin Laden, and the man responsible for murdering more than 3,000 American walked away.\nThis is George Bush's record, but it doesn't have to be our future.\nOn Tuesday, we have the opportunity to set a new course in Iraq...open up a new chapter in our relationship with the rest of the world...and do whatever it takes to defend America and keep our troops safe.\nThis can be our future.\nBut first we must choose.\nWhen I'm President, I will bring other nations to our side and train Iraqis so that we can succeed and bring our troops home. As president, I will fight a tougher, smarter, more effective war on terror. We will hunt down, capture, and kill the terrorists wherever they are. I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as president.\nBut I believe we need a president who can do more than one thing at a time.\nAmerica has always been driven by a powerful idea: that with hard work and good values, we can give our children a better life. Our economy, our society is built on that basic bargain: Everyone who works hard and does right should have the chance to get ahead.\nNot long ago, that middle-class dream was within reach of all those willing to work for it. But this President walked away from our basic bargain вЂ“ and today, America's great middle class is in danger because this President doesn't share your values.\nWith almost every choice he's made, George Bush has given more to those who have the most at the expense of middle-class families who are working hard to get ahead.\nJobs get shipped overseas, but the companies who send them there get tax breaks.\nToday, America is replacing high-paying, middle-class jobs with temporary and part-time jobs that don't pay enough to make ends meet. But big corporations keep getting higher profits and larger tax breaks.\nThe middle-class is paying a larger share of the tax burden, but the wealthiest individuals making an average of $1.2 million are getting $89 billion in tax cuts.\nAmerican families are earning less but paying more.\nHealth care's up 64 percent. College tuition's up 46 percent. Medicare premiums are up 56 percent. 5 million more Americans don't health care. 220,000 students couldn't afford college last year. But George Bush thought it was a good idea to give Enron a $254 million tax break, the big drug companies $139 billion in windfall profits, and Halliburton a $7 billion no-bid contract. You know, as Ronald Reagan used say, facts are stubborn things.\nThis is George Bush's record, but it doesn't have to be our future. On Tuesday, we have the opportunity to make sure the American Dream touches every American heart. We can bring back good-paying jobs for middle-class families so that they don't just get by вЂ“ they get ahead. We can bring down the cost of health care and child care and tuition so that you can pay the bills and give your children the same chance at life that your parents gave you.\nThis can be our future.\nBut first we must choose.\nIt's a choice between four more years of George Bush's policy to ship jobs overseas and give tax breaks to the companies that do it -- or a President who will reward the companies that create and keep good jobs here in the United States of America.\nYou can choose a fresh start. And when I'm President, that's what you'll get.\nOn Tuesday, you'll face a choice between four more years of George Bush's giveaways to the big drug companies and the big HMOs -- or a President who will finally make health care a right, and not a privilege, for every American.\nYou can choose a fresh start. And when I'm President, that's what you'll get.\nThis election is a choice between four more years of tax giveaways for millionaires along with a higher tax burden for you -- or a President who will cut middle-class taxes, raise the minimum wage, and make sure we guarantee women an equal day's pay for an equal day's work.\nYou can choose a fresh start. And when I'm President, that's what you'll get\nOn Tuesday, America faces a choice between four more years of an energy policy for big oil, of big oil, and by big oil -- or a President who finally makes America independent of Mideast oil in ten years. A choice between George Bush's policy that just yesterday showed record profits for oil companies and record gas prices for American consumers. I believe that America should rely on our own ingenuity and innovation, not the Saudi Royal family.\nYou can choose a fresh start. And when I'm President, that's what you'll get.\nI believe that the only way to do this is by coming together as One America. It is time for America to put the politics of polarization behind us. It is time to appeal to the best instincts of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike. It is time again for America to honor the truth that what unites us is stronger than what divides us. It is time for America to renew the faith that there is something for everyone single one of us to do вЂ“ and challenges each of us to try.\nMy fellow Americans, running for president has been a privilege and a gift. Over two years and more, I have traveled into the communities, the homes, and the town squares of America. I have seen heartache, but I have also seen hope. I have been told stories of struggle, but in those voices there is also a sense of optimism. The people I have met understand how hard the last four years have been, but they know in their hearts that if we believe in ourselves, America's best days are ahead of us.\nOur choice could not be clearer. And the stakes could not be higher.\nIn four days, we can change the course of our country. I ask for your vote and I ask for your help. When you go to the polls next Tuesday, bring your friends, your family, your neighbors. No one can afford to stand on the sidelines or sit this one out.\nIn four days, this campaign will end. The election will be in your hands. If you believe we need a fresh start in Iraq .... if you believe we can create and keep good jobs here in America ... if you believe we need to get health care costs under control ... if you believe in the promise of stem cell research ... if you believe our deficits are too high and we're too dependent on Mideast oil ... then I ask you to join me and together we'll change America.\nI see an America of rising opportunity. And I believe hope, not fear is our future.\nA woman in Ohio said something about a month ago.

And if you believe we need a fresh start in Iraq .... if you believe we can create and keep good jobs here in America ... if you believe we need to get health care costs under control ... if you believe in the promise of stem cell research ... if you believe our deficits are too high and we're too dependent on Mideast oil ...then I ask you to join me and together we'll change America.\nThank you and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2004-10-30", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation"}

You just have no idea how warming and how generous that welcome is, your love is, your affection, and I'm gratified by it. I'm sorry that we got here a little bit late and a bit short.\nEarlier today, I spoke to President Bush, and I offered him and Laura our congratulations on their victory. We had a good conversation and we talked about the danger of division in our country and the need – the desperate need – for unity, for finding the common ground, coming together. Today, I hope that we can begin the healing. In America it is vital that every vote count, and that every vote be counted. But the outcome should be decided by voters, not a protracted legal process.\nI would not give up this fight if there was a chance that we would prevail. But it is now clear that even when all the provisional ballots are counted, which they will be, there won't be enough outstanding votes for us to be able to win Ohio. And therefore, we can not win this election.\nMy friends, it was here that we began our campaign for the presidency. And all we had was hope and a vision for a better America. It was a privilege and a gift to spend two years traveling this country, coming to know so many of you. I wish that I could just wrap you in my arms and embrace each and every one of you individually all across this nation. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nAudience member: We still got your back!\nThank you, man. And I assure you – you watch – I'll still have yours.\nI will always be particularly grateful to the colleague that you just heard from who became my partner, my very close friend, an extraordinary leader, John Edwards. And I thank him for everything he did. John and I would be the first to tell you that we owe so much to our families. They're here with us today. They were with us every single step of the way. They sustained us. They went out on their own and they multiplied our campaign, all across this country.\nNo one did this more with grace and with courage and candor. For that, I love than my wife, Teresa. And I thank her. Thank you. And our children were there every single step of the way. It was unbelievable. Vanessa, Alex, Chris, Andre and John, from my family, and Elizabeth Edwards who is so remarkable and so strong and so smart. And Johnny and Cate who went out there on her own just like my daughters did. And also Emma Claire and Jack who were up beyond their bedtime last night, like a lot of us.\nI want to thank my crewmates and my friends from 35 years ago. That great \"band of brothers\" who crisscrossed this country on my behalf through 2004. Thank you. They had the courage to speak the truth back then, and they spoke it again this year, and for that, I will forever be grateful.\nAnd thanks also as I look around here to friends and family of a lifetime. Some from college, friends made all across the years, and then all across the miles of this campaign. You are so special. You brought the gift of your passion for our country and the possibilities of change, and that will stay with us, and with this country forever.\nThanks to Democrats and Republicans and independents who stood with us, and everyone who voted no matter who their candidate was.\nAnd thanks to my absolutely unbelievable, dedicated staff, led by a wonderful campaign manager Mary Beth Cahill, who did an extraordinary job. There's so much written about campaigns, and there's so much that Americans never get to see. I wish they could all spend a day on a campaign and see how hard these folks work to make America better. It is its own unbelievable contribution to our democracy, and it's a gift to everybody. But especially to me. And I'm grateful to each and every one of you, and I thank your families, and I thank you for the sacrifices you've made.\nAnd to all the volunteers, all across this country who gave so much of themselves. You know, thanks to William Field, a six-year-old who collected $680, a quarter and a dollar at a time selling bracelets during the summer to help change America. Thanks to Michael Benson from Florida who I spied in a rope line holding a container of money, and turned out he raided his piggy bank and wanted to contribute. And thanks to Alana Wexler who is 11 years old and started kids for Kerry all across our country. I think of the brigades of students and people, young and old, who took time to travel, time off from work, their own vacation time to work in states far and wide. They braved the hot days of summer and the cold days of the fall and the winter to knock on doors because they were determined to open the doors of opportunity to all Americans. They worked their hearts out, and I wish... you don't know how much they, could have brought this race home for you for them, and I say to them now, don't lose faith.\nWhat you did made a difference, and building on itself -- building on itself, we go on to make a difference another day. I promise you, that time will come. The time will come, the election will come when your work and your ballots will change the world, and it's worth fighting for.\nI want to especially say to the American people in this journey, you have given me honor and the gift of listening and learning from you. I have visited your homes. I have visited your churches. I've visited your union halls. I've heard your stories, I know your struggles, I know your hopes. They're part of me now, and I will never forget you, and I'll never stop fighting for you.\nYou may not understand completely in what ways, but it is true when I say to you that you have taught me and you've tested me and you've lifted me up, and you made me stronger, I did my best to express my vision and my hopes for America. We worked hard, and we fought hard, and I wish that things had turned out a little differently.\nBut in an American election, there are no losers, because whether or not our candidates are successful, the next morning we all wake up as Americans. And that -- that is the greatest privilege and the most remarkable good fortune that can come to us on earth.\nWith that gift also comes obligation. We are required now to work together for the good of our country. In the days ahead, we must find common cause. We must join in common effort without remorse or recrimination, without anger or rancor. America is in need of unity and longing for a larger measure of compassion.\nI hope President Bush will advance those values in the coming years. I pledge to do my part to try to bridge the partisan divide. I know this is a difficult time for my supporters, but I ask them, all of you, to join me in doing that.\nNow, more than ever, with our soldiers in harm's way, we must stand together and succeed in Iraq and win the war on terror. I will also do everything in my power to ensure that my party, a proud Democratic Party, stands true to our best hopes and ideals.\nI believe that what we started in this campaign will not end here. And I know our fight goes on to put America back to work and make our economy a great engine of job growth. Our fight goes on to make affordable health care an accessible right for all Americans, not a privilege. Our fight goes on to protect the environment, to achieve equality, to push the frontiers of science and discovery, and to restore America's reputation in the world. I believe that all of this will happen -- and sooner than we may think -- because we're America. And America always moves forward.\nI've been honored to represent the citizens of this commonwealth in the United States Senate now for 20 years. And I pledge to them that in the years ahead, I'm going to fight on for the people and for the principles that I've learned and lived with here in Massachusetts.\nI'm proud of what we stood for in this campaign, and of what we accomplished. When we began, no one thought it was possible to even make this a close race. But we stood for real change, change that would make a real difference in the life of our nation, the lives of our families. And we defined that choice to America.\nI'll never forget the wonderful people who came to our rallies, who stood in our rope lines, who put their hopes in our hands, who invested in each and every one of us. I saw in them the truth that America is not only great, but it is good.\nSo here -- so with a grateful heart -- I leave this campaign with a prayer that has even greater meaning to me now that I've come to know our vast country so much better. Thanks to all of you and what a privilege it has been. And that prayer is very simple: God bless America. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2004-11-03", "title": "Address Conceding the Presidential Election at Fanueil Hall in Boston"}
